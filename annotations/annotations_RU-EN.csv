Various models for transition between electron and nuclear subsystems are compared in the case of electron attachment to the SF6 molecule.;2 Problem
Experimental data, including the cross section of electron attachment to this molecule as a function of the electron energy and vibrational temperature, the rate constants of this process in swarm experiments, and the rates of the chemionization process involving Rydberg atoms and the SF6 molecule, are collected and treated.;42 Results-Reference
Based on the data and on the resonant character of electron capture into an autodetachment ion state in accordance with the Breit-Wigner formula, we find that intersection of the molecule and negative ion electron terms proceeds above the potential well bottom of the molecule with the barrier height 0.05-0.1 eV, and the transition between these electron terms has both the tunnel and above-barrier character.;41 Results-Specific
The limit of small electron energies \varepsilon for the electron attachment cross section at room vibrational temperature takes place at \varepsilon \ll 2 meV, while in the range 2 meV\ll \varepsilon \ll 80 meV, the cross section is inversely proportional to \varepsilon.;41 Results-Specific
In considering the attachment process as a result of the interaction between the electron and vibrational degrees of freedom, we find the coupling factor f between them to be f=aT at low vibrational temperatures T with a \approx 3\cdot 10^{-4} K-1.;41 Results-Specific
The coupling factor is independent of the temperature at T>400 K.;41 Results-Specific

Many interesting nonlinear effects are based on the strong interaction of motional degrees of freedom of atoms with an optical cavity field.;1 Background
Among them is the spatial self-organization of atoms in a pattern where the atoms group in either odd or even sites of the cavity-induced optical potential.;1 Background
An experimental observation of this effect can be simplified by using, along with the original cavity-induced feedback, an additional electronic feedback based on the detection of light leaking the cavity and the control of the optical potential for the atoms.;52 Conclusions-Specific
Following our previous study, we show that this approach is more efficient from the laser power perspective than the original scheme without the electronic feedback.;2 Problem

We present the results of a systematic study of Knudsen's flow of Rb atoms in cylindrical capillary cells coated with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) compound.;2 Problem
The purpose of the investigation is to determine the characterization of the coating in terms of the sticking probability and sticking time of Rb on the two types of coating of high and medium viscosities.;2 Problem
We report the measurement of the sticking probability of an Rb atom to the coating equal to 4.3\cdot10^{-5}, which corresponds to the number of bounces 2.3\cdot10^4 at room temperature.;41 Results-Specific
These parameters are the same for the two kinds of PDMS used.;41 Results-Specific
We find that at room temperature, the respective sticking times for high-viscosity and medium-viscosity PDMS are 22\pm3 \mus and 49\pm6 \mus.;41 Results-Specific
These sticking times are about million times larger than the sticking time derived from the surface Rb atom adsorption energy and temperature of the coating.;41 Results-Specific
A tentative explanation of this surprising result is proposed based on the bulk diffusion of the atoms that collide with the surface and penetrate inside the coating.;42 Results-Reference
The results can be important in many resonance cell experiments, such as the efficient magneto-optical trapping of rare elements or radioactive isotopes and in experiments on the light-induced drift effect.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

The wave function of a moderately cold atom in a stationary near-resonant standing light wave delocalizes very fast due to wave packet splitting.;2 Problem
However, we show that frequency modulation of the field can suppress packet splitting for some atoms whose specific velocities are in a narrow range.;2 Problem
These atoms remain localized in a small space for a long time.;42 Results-Reference
We demonstrate and explain this effect numerically and analytically.;32 Method-Procedure
We also demonstrate that the modulated field can not only trap but also cool the atoms.;42 Results-Reference
We perform a numerical experiment with a large atomic ensemble having wide initial velocity and energy distributions.;32 Method-Procedure
During the experiment, most of atoms leave the wave while the trapped atoms have a narrow energy distribution.;42 Results-Reference

We investigate the Jordan-Wigner fermion clusters with a stationary distributed quantum pairwise discord.;2 Problem
Such clusters appear after the Jordan-Wigner transformation of a spin chain governed by the nearest-neighbor XY Hamiltonian with the particular initial state having one polarized node.;1 Background
We show that the quantum discord stationarity in such systems is not destroyed by the ''parasitic'' polarization of at least two types.;42 Results-Reference
The first type appears because the initial state with a single polarized node is hardly realizable experimentally, and therefore the low polarization of neighboring nodes must be taken into account.;41 Results-Specific
The second is the unavoidable additional noise polarization of all nodes.;41 Results-Specific
Although the stationarity may not be destroyed by perturbations of the above two types, the parasitic polarizations deform the pairwise discord distribution and may destroy clusters of correlated fermions with equal pairwise discords.;41 Results-Specific
Such deformations are studied in this paper.;2 Problem

We show that the lepton bag model considered in our previous paper BurGrBag, generating the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields of the Kerr-Newman (KN) solution, is supersymmetric and represents a BPS-saturated soliton interpolating between the internal vacuum state and the external KN solution.;42 Results-Reference
We obtain Bogomolnyi equations for this phase transition and show that the Bogomolnyi bound determines all important features of this bag model, including its stable shape.;42 Results-Reference
In particular, for the stationary KN solution, the BPS bound provides stability of the ellipsoidal form of the bag and the formation of the ring-string structure at its border, while for the periodic electromagnetic excitations of the KN solution, the BPS bound controls the deformation of the surface of the bag, reproducing the known flexibility of bag models.;41 Results-Specific

We try to find grounds for the standard nucleon QCD sum rules, based on a more detailed description of the QCD vacuum.;2 Problem
We calculate the polarization operator of the nucleon current in the instanton medium.;32 Method-Procedure
The medium (QCD vacuum) is assumed to be a composition of the small-size instantons and some long-wave gluon fluctuations.;Unknown
We solve the corresponding QCD sum rule equations and demonstrate that there is a solution with the value of the nucleon mass close to the physical one if the fraction of the small-size instantons contribution is w_s \approx 2/3.;41 Results-Specific

The Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH) solution exhibits the external gravitational and electromagnetic field corresponding to that of the Dirac electron.;1 Background
For the large spin/mass ratio, a\gg m, the BH loses horizons and obtains a naked singular ring creating two-sheeted topology.;1 Background
This space is regularized by the Higgs mechanism of symmetry breaking, leading to an extended particle that has a regular spinning core compatible with the external KN solution.;1 Background
We show that this core has much in common with the known MIT and SLAC bag models, but has the important advantage of being in accordance with the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields of the KN solution.;42 Results-Reference
A peculiar two-sheeted structure of Kerr's gravity provides a framework for the implementation of the Higgs mechanism of symmetry breaking in configuration space in accordance with the concept of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.;41 Results-Specific
Similar to other bag models, the KN bag is flexible and pliant to deformations.;42 Results-Reference
For parameters of a spinning electron, the bag takes the shape of a thin rotating disk of the Compton radius, with a ring-string structure and a quark-like singular pole formed at the sharp edge of this disk, indicating that the considered lepton bag forms a single bag-string-quark system.;42 Results-Reference

Drag of electrons of a one-dimensional ballistic nanowire by a nearby one-dimensional beam of ions is considered.;42 Results-Reference
We assume that the ion beam is represented by an ensemble of heavy ions of the same velocity V.;32 Method-Procedure
The ratio of the drag current to the primary current carried by the ion beam is calculated.;32 Method-Procedure
The drag current turns out to be a nonmonotonic function of velocity V.;41 Results-Specific
It has a sharp maximum for V near vnF/2, where n is the number of the uppermost electron (miniband channel) taking part in conductance and vnF is the corresponding Fermi velocity.;41 Results-Specific
This means that the phenomenon of ion beam drag can be used for investigation of the electron spectra of ballistic nanostructures.;52 Conclusions-Specific
We note that whereas observation of the Coulomb drag between two parallel quantum wires may be in general complicated by phenomena such as tunneling and phonon drag, the Coulomb drag of electrons of a one-dimensional ballistic nanowire by an ion beam is free from such spurious effects.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Processes are considered for conversion into a fractal structure of a hot metal micron-size particle that is located in a buffer gas or a gas flow and is heated by an external electric or electromagnetic source or by a plasma.;2 Problem
The parameter of this heating is the particle temperature, which is the same in all of the particle volume because of its small size and high conductivity.;1 Background
Three processes determine the particle heat balance: particle radiation, evaporation of metal atoms from the particle surface, and heat transport to the surrounding gas due to its thermal conductivity.;1 Background
The particle heat balance is analyzed based on these processes, which are analogous to those for bulk metals with the small particle size and its high temperature taken into account.;32 Method-Procedure
Outside the particle, where the gas temperature is lower than on its surface, the formed metal vapor in a buffer gas flow is converted into clusters.;42 Results-Reference
Clusters grow as a result of coagulation, until they become liquid, and then clusters form fractal aggregates if they are removed form the gas flow.;41 Results-Specific
Subsequently, association of fractal aggregates join into a fractal structure.;41 Results-Specific
The rate of this process increases in middle electric fields, and the formed fractal structure has features of aerogels and fractal fibers.;42 Results-Reference
As a result of a chain of the above processes, a porous metal film may be manufactured for use as a filter or catalyst for gas flows.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We describe the interaction of a Rayleigh surface acoustic wave (SAW) traveling on the semiconductor substrate with the excitonic gas in a double quantum well located on the substrate surface.;2 Problem
We study the SAW attenuation and its velocity renormalization due to the coupling to excitons.;2 Problem
Both the deformation potential and piezoelectric mechanisms of the SAW-exciton interaction are considered.;42 Results-Reference
We focus on the frequency and excitonic density dependences of the SAW absorption coefficient and velocity renormalization at temperatures both above and well below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of the excitonic gas.;2 Problem
We demonstrate that the SAW attenuation and velocity renormalization are strongly different below and above the critical temperature.;42 Results-Reference

A new approach to the diffusion-limited reaction kinetics for particles migrating by random walks on discrete lattice sites and reacting when two particles occupy the same site is extended to a more general case of a large reaction radius and applied to the problem of the recombination rate of point defects in cubic lattices.;2 Problem

The possibility of a structure phase transition at TSP is predicted.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The recent increase in the number of studies of RFe11-xMx compounds is related to their promising application as permanent magnets.;1 Background
However, the insufficiently high value of the Curie temperature TC of these compounds is a barrier to their widespread use.;2 Problem
The increase in the Curie temperature of these compounds is achieved by doping with the light nonmetallic atoms such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon.;32 Method-Procedure
In this paper, it is shown numerically that this doping leads to drastic changes of the electronic band dispersions in a wide energy region around the Fermi level.;42 Results-Reference
This in turn changes values of the magnetic moments of ions and Heisenberg exchange interaction parameters.;42 Results-Reference
The values of ab initio calculated magnetic moments and direct exchange interaction parameters allow to calculate the Curie temperatures for both parent and nitrogen-doped compounds within the mean-field approach to the Heisenberg model in the sample of YFe11Mo, a typical representative of the R(Fe,M)12L class.;42 Results-Reference
Theoretical values of TC obtained for YFe11Mo and YFe11MoN (514 K and 723 K respectively) are consistent with experimental ones (472 K and 664 K) with an accuracy of 10%.;41 Results-Specific
Also, the calculated increase in TC upon nitrogenization (about 200 K) is in good agreement with the experimental data.;41 Results-Specific

We derive a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expansion in the disordered attractive Hubbard model within the combined Nozieres-Schmitt-Rink and DMFT+Σ approximation.;2 Problem
Restricting ourselves to the homogeneous expansion, we analyze the disorder dependence of GL expansion coefficients for a wide range of attractive potentials U, from the weak BCS coupling region to the strong-coupling limit, where superconductivity is described by Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of preformed Cooper pairs.;32 Method-Procedure
We show that for the a semi-elliptic ''bare'' density of states of the conduction band, the disorder influence on the GL coefficients A and B before quadratic and quartic terms of the order parameter, as well as on the specific heat discontinuity at the superconducting transition, is of a universal nature at any strength of the attractive interaction and is related only to the general widening of the conduction band by disorder.;42 Results-Reference
In general, disorder growth increases the values of the coefficients A and B, leading either to a suppression of the specific heat discontinuity (in the weak-coupling limit), or to its significant growth (in the strong-coupling region).;42 Results-Reference
However, this behavior actually confirms the validity of the generalized Anderson theorem, because the disorder dependence of the superconducting critical temperature Tc is also controlled only by disorder widening of the conduction band (density of states).;51 Conclusions-Explanation

The electronic structure of Gd-doped MgO is investigated using the LSDA+U local spin density approximation (with U-correction) method and compared to the MgO structure.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
The total density of states obtained accounting for the correlation effects in the 4f shell of gadolinium is found to be formed by the oxygen 2p states at the valence band and the 4f gadolinium occupied states, while the conduction band is represented by a mixture of empty electronic states.;42 Results-Reference
Magnetic properties of the calculated Gd-doped MgO are found to be formed solely by the Gd-4f-magnetic moment of about 7 μB, in good agreement with recent experimental results suggesting a ferromagnetic coupling of the local magnetic moments induced by Gd.;41 Results-Specific

We discuss the most prominent and intensively studied S=1 pseudospin formalism for the extended boson Hubbard model (EBHM) with the on-site Hilbert space truncated to the three lowest occupation states n=0, 1, 2.;2 Problem
The EBHM Hamiltonian is a paradigmatic model for the highly topical field of ultracold gases in optical lattices.;1 Background
The generalized non-Heisenberg effective pseudospin Hamiltonian does provide a deep link with a boson system and a physically clear description of ''the myriad of phases'', from uniform Mott insulating phases and density waves to two types of superfluids and supersolids.;42 Results-Reference
We argue that the 2D pseudospin system is prone to a topological phase separation and focus on several types of unconventional skyrmion-like topological structures in 2D boson systems, which have not been analyzed until now.;52 Conclusions-Specific
The structures are characterized by a complicated interplay of insulating and two superfluid phases with a single-boson and two-boson condensation, respectively.;42 Results-Reference

We explore a combined effect of hexagonal warping and a finite effective mass on both the tunneling density of electronic surface states and the structure of Landau levels of 3D topological insulators.;2 Problem
We find the increasing warping to transform the square-root van Hove singularity into a logarithmic one.;32 Method-Procedure
For moderate warping, an additional logarithmic singularity and a jump in the tunneling density of surface states appear.;42 Results-Reference
By combining the perturbation theory and the WKB approximation, we calculate the Landau levels in the presence of hexagonal warping.;32 Method-Procedure
We predict that due to the degeneracy removal, the evolution of Landau levels in the magnetic field is drastically modified.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Using the generalized DMFT+Σ approach,  we study the influence of disorder on single-particle properties of the normal phase and the superconducting transition temperature in the attractive Hubbard model.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
A wide range of attractive potentials U is studied, from the weak coupling region, where both the instability of the normal phase and superconductivity are well described by the BCS model, to the strong-coupling region, where the superconducting transition is due to Bose-Einstein condensation BEC) of compact Cooper pairs, formed at temperatures much higher than the superconducting transition temperature.;32 Method-Procedure
We study two typical models of the conduction band with semi-elliptic and flat densities of states, respectively appropriate for three-dimensional and two-dimensional systems.;2 Problem
For the semi-elliptic density of states, the disorder influence on all single-particle properties (e.g., density of states) is universal for an arbitrary strength of electronic correlations and disorder and is due to only the general disorder widening of the conduction band.;42 Results-Reference
In the case of a flat density of states, universality is absent in the general case, but still the disorder influence is mainly due to band widening, and the universal behavior is restored for large enough disorder.;42 Results-Reference
Using the combination of DMFT+Σ and Nozieres-Schmitt-Rink approximations, we study the disorder influence on the superconducting transition temperature Tc for a range of characteristic values of U and disorder, including the BCS-BEC crossover region and the limit of strong-coupling.;31 Method-Specific
Disorder can either suppress Tc (in the weak-coupling region) or significantly increase Tc (in the strong-coupling region).;42 Results-Reference
However, in all cases, the generalized Anderson theorem is valid and all changes of the superconducting critical temperature are essentially due to only the general disorder widening of the conduction band.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

We consider formulations of the functional renormalization-group (fRG) flow for correlated electronic systems with the dynamical mean-field theory as a starting point.;2 Problem
We classify the corresponding renormalization-group schemes into those neglecting one-particle irreducible six-point vertices with respect to the local Green's functions) and neglecting one-particle reducible six-point vertices.;32 Method-Procedure
The former class is represented by the recently introduced DMF2RG approach 31, but also by the scale-dependent generalization of the one-particle irreducible representation (with respect to local Green's functions, 1PI-LGF) of the generating functional 20.;42 Results-Reference
The second class is represented by the fRG flow within the dual fermion approach 16,32.;42 Results-Reference
We compare formulations of the fRG approach in each of these cases and suggest their further application to study 2D systems within the Hubbard model.;32 Method-Procedure

The localized opical modes in spiral photonic liquid crystals are theoretically studied for the certainty at the example of chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) for the case of CLC with an anisotropic local absorption.;2 Problem
The chosen here model (absence of dielectric interfaces in the studied structures) allows one to get rid off the polarization mixing at the surfaces of the CLC layer and the defect structure (DMS) and to reduce the corresponding equations to the equations for the light of diffracting in the CLC polarization only.;42 Results-Reference
The dispersion equations determining connection of the EM and DM frequencies with the CLC layer parameters (anisotropy of local absorption, CLC order parameter) and other parameters of the DMS are obtained.;42 Results-Reference
Analytic expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients of CLC layer and DMS for the case of CLC with an anisotropic local absorption are presented and analyzed.;42 Results-Reference
It is shown that the CLC layers with locally anisotropic absorption reduce the EM and DM lifetimes (and increase the lasing threshold) by the way different from the case of CLC with an isotropic local absorption.;42 Results-Reference
Due to the Borrmann effect revealing of which is different at the opposite stop-band edges in the case of CLC layers with an anisotropic local absorption the EM life-times for the EM frequencies at the opposite stop-bands edges may be significanately different.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
The options of experimental observations of the theoretically revealed phenomena are briefly discussed.;53 Conclusions-Reference

An analytic approach to the theory of the optical defect modes in photonic liquid crystals in the case of an active defect layer is developed.;42 Results-Reference
The analytic study is facilitated by the choice of the problem parameters related to the dielectric properties of the studied structures.;42 Results-Reference
The chosen models allow eliminating polarization mixing at the external surfaces of the studied structures.;42 Results-Reference
The dispersion equations determining the relation of the defect mode (DM) frequency to the dielectric characteristics of an isotropic, birefringent and absorbing amplifying) defect layer and its thickness are obtained.;42 Results-Reference
Analytic expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients of the defect mode structure (DMS) photonic liquid crystal-active defect layer-photonic liquid crystal) are presented and analyzed.;42 Results-Reference
The effect of anomalously strong light absorption at the defect mode frequency for an absorbing defect layer is discussed.;42 Results-Reference
It is shown that in a distributed feedback lasing at the DMS with an amplifying defect layer, adjusting the lasing frequency to the DM frequency results in a significant decrease in the lasing threshold and the threshold gain decreases as the defect layer thickness increases.;42 Results-Reference
It is found that generally speaking the layer birefringence and dielectric jumps at the interfaces of the defect layer and photonic liquid crystal reduce the DM lifetime in comparison with the DMS with an isotropic defect layer without dielectric jumps at the interfaces.;42 Results-Reference
Correspondingly, generally speaking, the effect of anomalously strong light absorption at the defect mode frequency and the decrease in the lasing threshold are not so pronounced as in the case of the DMS with an isotropic defect layer without dielectric jumps at the interfaces.;42 Results-Reference
The case of a DMS with a low defect layer birefringence and sufficiently large dielectric jumps are studied in detail.;42 Results-Reference
The options of effectively influencing the DM parameters by changing the defect layer dielectric properties, and the birefringence in particular, are discussed.;53 Conclusions-Reference

The dynamics of a bubble in a dielectric liquid under the influence of a uniform external electric field are considered.;42 Results-Reference
It is shown that in the situation where the boundary motion is determined only by electrostatic forces, the special regime of fluid motion can be realized for which the velocity and electric field potentials are linearly related.;42 Results-Reference
In the two-dimensional case, the corresponding equations are reduced to an equation similar in structure to the well-known Laplacian growth equation, which, in turn, can be reduced to a finite number of ordinary differential equations.;42 Results-Reference
This allows us to obtain exact solutions for asymmetric bubble deformations resulting in the formation of a finite-time singularity (cusp).;42 Results-Reference

We briefly review the generalized dynamic mean-field theory DMFT+Σ applied to both repulsive and attractive disordered Hubbard models.;2 Problem
We examine the general problem of metal-insulator transition and the phase diagram in the repulsive case, as well as the BCS-BEC crossover region of the attractive model, demonstrating a certain universality of single-electron properties under disordering in both models.;2 Problem
We also discuss and compare the results for the density of states and dynamic conductivity in the repulsive and attractive cases and the generalized Anderson theorem behavior of the superconducting critical temperature in the disordered attractive case.;2 Problem
A brief discussion of the behavior of Ginzburg-Landau coefficients under disordering in the BCS-BEC crossover region is also presented.;2 Problem

We theoretically study nonradiative and radiative energy transfer between two localized quantum emitters, a donor (initially excited) and an acceptor (receiving the excitation).;2 Problem
The rates of nonradiative and radiative processes are calculated depending on the spatial and spectral separation between the donor and acceptor states and for different donor and acceptor lifetimes for typical parameters of semiconductor quantum dots.;32 Method-Procedure
We find that the donor lifetime can be significantly modified only due to the nonradiative Förster energy transfer process at donor-acceptor separations of approximately 10 nm - depending on the acceptor radiative lifetime) and for the energy detuning not larger than 1-2 meV.;41 Results-Specific
The efficiency of the nonradiative Förster energy transfer process under these conditions is close to unity and decreases rapidly with an increase in the donor-acceptor distance or energy detuning.;42 Results-Reference
At large donor-acceptor separations greater than 40 nm, the radiative corrections to the donor lifetime are comparable with nonradiative ones but are relatively weak.;41 Results-Specific

We study holographic thermalization of a strongly coupled theory inspired by two colliding shock waves in a vacuum confining background.;2 Problem
Holographic thermalization means a black hole formation, in fact, a trapped surface formation.;1 Background
As the vacuum confining background, we considered the well-know bottom-up AdS/QCD model that provides the Cornell potential and reproduces the QCD β-function.;32 Method-Procedure
We perturb the vacuum background by colliding domain shock waves that are assumed to be holographically dual to heavy ions collisions.;32 Method-Procedure
Our main physical assumption is that we can make a restriction on the time of trapped surface formation, which results in a natural limitation on the size of the domain where the trapped surface is produced.;32 Method-Procedure
This limits the intermediate domain where the main part of the entropy is produced.;32 Method-Procedure
In this domain, we can use an intermediate vacuum background as an approximation to the full confining background.;32 Method-Procedure
We find that the dependence of the multiplicity on energy for the intermediate background has an asymptotic expansion whose first term depends on energy as E1/3, which is very similar to the experimental dependence of particle multiplicities on the colliding ion energy obtained from the RHIC and LHC.;42 Results-Reference
However, this first term, at the energies where the approximation of the confining metric by the intermediate background works, does not saturate the exact answer, and we have to take the nonleading terms into account.;42 Results-Reference

We study the creation of high-energy SM particles in the Starobinsky model of dark energy (a variant of F(R)-gravity) inside the regions contracting due to the Jeans instability.;2 Problem
In this modification of gravity, the additional degree of freedom - a scalaron - behaves as a particle with the mass depending on matter density.;1 Background
Therefore, when the mass changes, light scalarons could be created at a nonadiabatic stage.;42 Results-Reference
Later, the scalaron mass grows and can reach large values, even the value 1013 GeV, favored by early time inflation.;41 Results-Specific
Heavy scalarons decay contributing to the cosmic ray flux.;41 Results-Specific
We analytically calculate the number density of created particles for the exponential (Jeans) contraction and find it negligibly small for the phenomenologically viable and cosmologically interesting range of model parameters.;32 Method-Procedure
We expect similar results for a generic model of F(R)-gravity mimicking the cosmological constant.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The double Higgs production in the models with isospin-triplet scalars is studied.;2 Problem
It is shown that in the see-saw type-II model, the mode with an intermediate heavy scalar, pp→ H+X→ 2h+X, may have the cross section that is comparable with that in the Standard Model.;42 Results-Reference
In the Georgi-Machacek model, this cross section could be much larger than in the Standard Model because the vacuum expectation value of the triplet can be large.;42 Results-Reference

We experimentally investigate spin-polarized electron transport between a permalloy ferromagnet and the edge of a two-dimensional electron system with band inversion, realized in a narrow, 8 nm wide, HgTe quantum well.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
In a zero magnetic field, we observe strong asymmetry of the edge potential distribution with respect to the ferromagnetic ground lead.;42 Results-Reference
This result indicates that the helical edge channel, specific for the structures with band inversion even at the conductive bulk, is strongly coupled to the ferromagnetic side contact, possibly due to the effects of proximity magnetization.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
This allows selective and spin-sensitive contacting of helical edge states.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Based on a special variant of the plaquette expansion, an operator is constructed whose eigenvalues give the low-energy singlet spectrum of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with nearest-heighbor and frustrating next-nearest-neighbor exchange couplings J1 and J2.;32 Method-Procedure
It is well known that a nonmagnetic phase arises in this model for 0.4\lesssim J_2/J_1\lesssim 0.6, sandwiched by two Néel ordered phases.;1 Background
In agreement with previous results, we observe a first-order quantum phase transition (QPT) at J_2\approx 0.64J_1 from the nonmagnetic phase to the Néel one.;41 Results-Specific
A large gap (\gtrsim 0.4J_1) is found in the singlet spectrum for J2<0.64J1, which excludes a gapless spin-liquid state for 0.4\lesssim J_2/J_1\lesssim 0.6 and the deconfined quantum criticality scenario for the QPT to another Néel phase.;41 Results-Specific
We observe a first-order QPT at J_2\approx 0.55J_1, presumably between two nonmagnetic phases.;41 Results-Specific

The dynamics of Dirac-Weyl spin-polarized wavepackets driven by a periodic electric field is considered for the electrons in a mesoscopic quantum dot formed at the edge of the two-dimensional HgTe/CdTe topological insulator with Dirac-Weyl massless energy spectra, where the motion of carriers is less sensitive to disorder and impurity potentials.;2 Problem
It is observed that the interplay of strongly coupled spin and charge degrees of freedom creates the regimes of irregular dynamics in both coordinate and spin channels.;42 Results-Reference
The border between the regular and irregular regimes determined by the strength and frequency of the driving field is found analytically within the quasiclassical approach by means of the Ince-Strutt diagram for the Mathieu equation, and is supported by full quantum mechanical simulations of the driven dynamics.;42 Results-Reference
The investigation of quasienergy spectrum by Floquet approach reveals the presence of non-Poissonian level statistics, which indicates the possibility of chaotic quantum dynamics and corresponds to the areas of parameters for irregular regimes within the quasiclassical approach.;42 Results-Reference
We find that the influence of weak disorder leads to partial suppression of the dynamical chaos.;42 Results-Reference
Our findings are of interest both for progress in the fundamental field of quantum chaotic dynamics and for further experimental and technological applications of spin-dependent phenomena in nanostructures based on topological insulators.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We study an excitation of surface plasmons (SPs) due to the scattering of light by a dipole nanoparticle located near a flat air-metal interface.;2 Problem
It is well known that such a scattering can reveal asymmetric behavior of excited SPs with respect to the plane of incidence of light.;1 Background
This asymmetric SP excitation, which takes place at the incidence of elliptically polarized light, is often associated with the so-called photonic spin Hall effect caused by the interplay between rotating polarization of a nanoparticle and the intrinsic field angular momentum of the SP.;1 Background
We show that this photonic spin Hall effect can be applied for the SP excitation control, which allows managing the SP directivity pattern and amplitude.;52 Conclusions-Specific
The possibilities of SP control can also be extended using nanoparticles with anisotropic polarizability.;52 Conclusions-Specific
We believe that manipulations with SPs at a nanometer scale may find some applications in modern nanoplasmonics.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Based on such a nonperturbative approach, we rigorously prove that the total energy of free nonlinear oscillations in a distributive conservative system, such as that considered in our work, can exactly coincide with the sum of energies of the normal modes of the system.;42 Results-Reference
This fact implies that the energy orthogonality property, which has so far been known to hold only for linear oscillations and fields, can also be observed in a nonlinear oscillatory system.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The statistical theory of diffusion in concentrated BCC and FCC alloys with arbitrary pairwise interatomic interactions based on the master equation approach is developed.;42 Results-Reference
Vacancy-atom correlations are described using both the second-shell-jump and the nearest-neighbor-jump approximations which are shown to be usually sufficiently accurate.;32 Method-Procedure
General expressions for Onsager coefficients in terms of microscopic interatomic interactions and some statistical averages are given.;42 Results-Reference
Both the analytical kinetic mean-field and the Monte Carlo methods for finding these averages are described.;42 Results-Reference
The theory developed is used to describe sharp concentration dependences of diffusion coefficients in several iron-based alloy systems.;32 Method-Procedure
For the BCC alloys FeCu, FeMn, and FeNi, we predict the notable increase of the iron self-diffusion coefficient with solute concentration c, up to several times, even though values of c possible for these alloys do not exceed some percent.;42 Results-Reference
For the BCC alloys FeCr at high temperatures T\gtrsim 1400 K, we show that the very strong and peculiar concentration dependences of both tracer and chemical diffusion coefficients observed in these alloys can be naturally explained by the theory, without invoking exotic models discussed earlier.;42 Results-Reference

The effect of surface states of silicon nanocrystals embedded in silicon dioxide on the photoluminescent properties of the nanocrystals is reported.;42 Results-Reference
We have investigated the time-resolved and stationary photoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals in the matrix of silicon dioxide in the visible and infrared spectral ranges at 77 and 300 K.;32 Method-Procedure
The structures containing silicon nanocrystals were prepared by the high-temperature annealing of multilayer SiOx/SiO2 films.;32 Method-Procedure
The understanding of the experimental results on photoluminescence is underlain by a model of autolocalized states arising on surface Si-Si dimers.;32 Method-Procedure
The emission of autocatalized excitons is found for the first time, and the energy level of the autolocalized states is determined.;42 Results-Reference
The effect of these states on the mechanism of the excitation and the photoluminescence properties of nanocrystals is discussed for a wide range of their dimensions.;42 Results-Reference
It is reliably shown that the cause of the known blue boundary of photoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals in the silicon dioxide matrix is the capture of free excitons on autolocalized surface states.;42 Results-Reference

Viewing shungite as loosely packed fractal nets of graphene-based (reduced graphene oxide, rGO) quantum dots GQDs), we consider photoluminescence of the latter as a convincing proof of the structural concept as well as of the GQD attribution to individual rGO fragments.;2 Problem
We study emission from shungite GQDs for colloidal dispersions in water, carbon tetrachloride, and toluene at both room and low temperatures.;32 Method-Procedure
As expected, the photoluminescence of the GQD aqueous dispersions is quite similar to that of synthetic GQDs of the rGO origin.;42 Results-Reference
The morphological study of shungite dispersions shows a steady trend of GQDs to form fractals and to drastically change the colloid fractal structure caused by the solvent exchange.;42 Results-Reference
Spectral study reveals a dual character of the emitting centers: individual GQDs are responsible for the spectra position while the fractal structure of GQD colloids provides high broadening of the spectra due to structural inhomogeneity, thus causing a peculiar dependence of the photoluminescence spectra on the excitation wavelength.;42 Results-Reference
For the first time, photoluminescence spectra of individual GQDs were observed in frozen toluene dispersions, which paves the way for a theoretical treatment of the GQD photonics.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Results of the measurements of magnetization as a function of temperature reveal the existence of a ferromagnetic phase transition in Cr0.26NbS1.74.;42 Results-Reference
The effective number of Bohr magnetons per Cr atom in the paramagnetic phase of Cr0.26NbS1.74 is \mu _{eff}\approx 4.6\mu _B, which matches the literature data for Cr1/3NbS2.;41 Results-Specific
Similarly, the effective number of Bohr magnetons per Cr atom in the saturation fields is rather close in both substances and corresponds to the number of magnetons in the Cr+3 ion.;42 Results-Reference
In contrast to the stoichiometric compound, Cr0.26NbS1.74 does not show a metamagnetic transition, that indicates the lack of a magnetic soliton.;42 Results-Reference

Gapless phases in ground states of low-dimensional quantum spin systems are rather ubiquitous.;1 Background
Their peculiarity is a remarkable sensitivity to external perturbations due to permanent criticality of such phases manifested by a slow (power-low) decay of pair correlations and the divergence of the corresponding susceptibility.;1 Background
A strong influence of various defects on the properties of the system in such a phase can then be expected.;2 Problem
Here, we consider the influence of vacancies on the thermodynamics of the simplest quantum model with a gapless phase, the isotropic spin-1/2 XX chain.;2 Problem
The existence of the exact solution of this model gives a unique opportunity to describe in detail the dramatic effect of dilution on the gapless phase - the appearance of an infinite series of quantum phase transitions resulting from level crossing under the variation of a longitudinal magnetic field.;2 Problem
We calculate the jumps in the field dependences of the ground-state longitudinal magnetization, susceptibility, entropy, and specific heat appearing at these transitions and show that they result in a highly nonlinear temperature dependence of these parameters at low T.;32 Method-Procedure, 41 Results-Specific
Also, the effect of enhancement of the magnetization and longitudinal correlations in the dilute chain is established.;42 Results-Reference
The changes of the pair spin correlators under dilution are also analyzed.;42 Results-Reference
The universality of the mechanism of the quantum transition generation suggests that similar effects of dilution can also be expected in gapless phases of other low-dimensional quantum spin systems.;52 Conclusions-Specific

A wide range of attractive potentials U is considered, from the weak-coupling limit, where superconducting instability is well described by the BCS approximation, to the strong-coupling region, where the superconducting transition is described by Bose condensation of compact Cooper pairs, which are formed at temperatures much exceeding the superconducting transition temperature.;32 Method-Procedure
We calculate the density of states, the spectral density, and the optical conductivity in the normal phase for this wide range of U, including the disorder effects.;42 Results-Reference
We also present the results on superconducting instability of the normal state dependence on the attraction strength U and the degree of disorder.;42 Results-Reference
The disorder influence on the critical temperature Tc is rather weak, suggesting in fact the validity of Anderson's theorem, with the account of the general widening of the conduction band due to disorder.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The earlier-suggested master equation approach is used to develop the statistical theory of steady-state diffusion in concentrated substitution alloys considering FCC alloys with the nearest-neighbor pairwise interactions as an example.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
General expressions for the Onsager coefficients in terms of microscopic interatomic interactions and some statistical averages are presented.;42 Results-Reference
We discuss methods of calculations of these averages using various statistical approximations and various approximations for description of vacancy correlations, with the full taking into account the vacancy-solute interactions.;42 Results-Reference
Our simplest statistical approximation, called the ``kinetic mean-field approximation'' (KMFA), corresponds to using the mean-field approximation for statistical averages and the pair-cluster approximation (PCA) for calculations of thermodynamic parameters, for dilute alloys, the KMFA is exact.;31 Method-Specific
To describe vacancy correlation effects at any concentrations, we develop both the nearest-neighbor-jump approximation and the second-shell-jump approximation.;31 Method-Specific
We also describe methods to take into account fluctuations in statistical averages using the PCA, and to describe non-pairwise vacancy-solute correlations using the triple vacancy-solute correlation model.;31 Method-Specific
For each of approximations and methods developed, we derive expressions for the Onsager coefficients at any composition of an alloy.;42 Results-Reference
For binary alloys, we also present expressions for the diffusion coefficients.;42 Results-Reference
The results obtained can provide a basis for microscopic calculations of diffusion coefficients at any composition of an alloy.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Phonon frequencies are calculated using the Born model taking the Coulomb interaction into account in the rigid-ion approximation.;31 Method-Specific
Raman scattering spectra are calculated in the framework of the deformation potential and electro-optical mechanisms.;32 Method-Procedure
Calculations show an angular dependence of the selection rules for optical phonons with different directions of the wave vectors.;42 Results-Reference
Drastic differences in the selection rules are found for experimental and calculated spectra.;42 Results-Reference

In a system of N interacting single-level quantum dots (QDs) we study relaxation dynamics and current-voltage characteristics determined by symmetry properties of the QD arrangement.;2 Problem
Different numbers of dots, initial charge configurations, and various coupling regimes to reservoirs are considered.;42 Results-Reference
We reveal that effective charge trapping occurs for particular regimes of coupling to the reservoir when more than two dots form a ring structure with the CN spatial symmetry.;42 Results-Reference
We reveal that the effective charge trapping caused by the CN spatial symmetry of N coupled QDs depends on the number of dots and the way of coupling to the reservoirs.;42 Results-Reference
We demonstrate that the charge trapping effect is directly connected with the formation of dark states, which are not coupled to reservoirs due to the system spatial symmetry CN.;42 Results-Reference

Magnetohydrodynamic equations for a heavy fluid over an arbitrary surface are studied in the shallow water approximation.;2 Problem
While solutions to the shallow water equations for a neutral fluid are well known, shallow water magnetohydrodynamic (SMHD) equations over a nonflat boundary have an additional dependence on the magnetic field, and the number of equations in the magnetic case exceeds that in the neutral case.;2 Problem
As a consequence, the number of Riemann invariants defining SMHD equations is also greater.;2 Problem
The classical simple wave solutions do not exist for hyperbolic SMHD equations over an arbitrary surface due to the appearance of a source term.;2 Problem
In this paper, we suggest a more general definition of simple wave solutions that reduce to the classical ones in the case of zero source term.;2 Problem
We show that simple wave solutions exist only for underlying surfaces that are slopes of constant inclination.;42 Results-Reference

General principles are discussed for a gas discharge plasma involving excited atoms where electron-atom collision processes dominate.;2 Problem
It is shown that an optimal kinetic model of this plasma at not large electric field strengths may be based on the rate constants of quenching excited atom states by electron impact.;42 Results-Reference
The self-consistent character of atom excitation in gas discharge plasma is important and results in the tail of the energy distribution function of electrons being affected by the excitation process, which in turn influences the excitation rate.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Analytic expressions for the second-order correlation function g(2)(t) are presented in strong and weak coupling regimes.;42 Results-Reference
The qualitative difference between the incoherent and coherent pumping schemes in the strong coupling case is revealed: under incoherent pumping, the correlation function demonstrates pronounced Rabi oscillations, but in the resonant pumping case, these oscillations are suppressed.;42 Results-Reference
At high incoherent pumping, the correlations decay monoexponentially.;42 Results-Reference

The estimated fraction of primary gamma rays in the flux of cosmic particles with energies E \gtrsim 5.4 \cdot 10^{16} eV is \epsilon_{\gamma}=\left(0.43^{+0.12}_{-0.11} \right) %, which corresponds to the intensity I_{\gamma}=\left(1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \right)\cdot 10^{-16} {\rm cm}^{-2}\cdot{\rm s}^{-1}\cdot{\rm sr}^{-1}.;41 Results-Specific

We present a detailed LDA^\prime+DMFT investigation of the doping dependence of correlation effects in the novel K1-x Fe2-y Se2 superconductor.;2 Problem
Calculations are performed at four different hole doping levels, starting from a hypothetical stoichiometric composition with the total number of electrons equal to 29 per unit cell through 28 and 27.2 electrons toward the case of 26.52, which corresponds to the chemical composition K0.76 Fe1.72 Se2 studied in recent ARPES experiments.;32 Method-Procedure
In the general case, the increase in hole doping leads to quasiparticle bands in a wide energy window \pm2 eV around the Fermi level becoming more broadened by lifetime effects, while correlation-induced compression of Fe-3d LDA^\prime bandwidths stays almost the same, of the order of 1.3 for all hole concentrations.;41 Results-Specific
However, close to the Fermi level, the situation is more complicated.;42 Results-Reference
In the energy interval from -1.0 eV to 0.4 eV, the bare Fe-3d LDA^\prime bands are compressed by significantly larger renormalization factors up to 5 with increased hole doping, while the value of Coulomb interaction remains the same.;41 Results-Specific
This fact manifests the increase in correlation effects with hole doping in the K1-x Fe2-y Se2 system.;42 Results-Reference
Moreover, in contrast to typical pnictides, K1-x Fe2-y Se2 does not have well-defined quasiparticle bands on the Fermi levels, but has a ``pseudogap''-like dark region instead.;42 Results-Reference
We also find that with the growth of hole doping Fe-3d orbitals of various symmetries are affected by correlations differently in different parts of the Brillouin zone.;42 Results-Reference
To illustrate this, we determine the quasiparticle mass renormalization factors and energy shifts that transform the bare Fe-3d LDA^\prime bands of various symmetries into LDA^\prime+DMFT quasiparticle bands.;32 Method-Procedure
These renormalization factors effectively mimic more complicated energy-dependent self-energy effects and can be used to analyze the available ARPES data.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Randomness of local sample characteristics translates to the quenched spatial inhomogeneity of the spectral gap, smearing the BCS coherence peak.;2 Problem
We show that various microscopic models of potential and magnetic disorder can be reduced to a universal phenomenological random order parameter model, whereas the details of the microscopic description are encoded in the correlation function of the order parameter fluctuations.;42 Results-Reference
The resulting form of the density of states is generally described by two parameters: the width Γ measuring the broadening of the BCS peak and the energy scale Γtail that controls the exponential decay of the density of subgap states.;1 Background
We refine the existing instanton approaches for determination of Γtail and show that they appear as limiting cases of a unified theory of optimal fluctuations in a nonlinear system.;42 Results-Reference
The application to various types of disorder is discussed.;53 Conclusions-Reference

For the studied crystals, exponential temperature-independent growth of the induced absorption (IA) with 60 ns rise time reflects the dynamics of the generation of electronic excitation.;42 Results-Reference
The kinetics of the IA exponential growth with temperature-dependent 3.5-11μs time constants reflect the dynamics of energy migration between neighboring tungstate (molibdate) ions to traps for the studied crystals.;41 Results-Specific
The multiexponential relaxation absorption kinetics strongly depend on temperature, and the relaxation decay time of induced absorption increased from tens to hundreds of ms to seconds under crystal cooling from 300 K to 77 K.;41 Results-Specific
We found that the increase in the laser pump repetition rate (0-10 Hz) leads to the accumulation of electronic excitations.;41 Results-Specific
Control of the repetition rate and the number of excitations allowed us to change the relaxation time of the induced absorption by more than two orders of magnitude.;41 Results-Specific
Due to accumulation of excitations at 77 K, the absorption relaxation time can exceed 100 s for PbWO4 and PbMoO4 crystals.;41 Results-Specific

We discuss the recently proposed LDA^\prime+DMFT approach providing a consistent parameter-free treatment of the so-called double counting problem arising within the LDA+DMFT hybrid computational method for realistic strongly correlated materials.;2 Problem
In this approach, the local exchange-correlation portion of the electron-electron interaction is excluded from self-consistent LDA calculations for strongly correlated electronic shells, e.g., d-states of transition metal compounds.;32 Method-Procedure
Then, the corresponding double-counting term in the LDA^\prime+DMFT Hamiltonian is consistently set in the local Hartree (fully localized limit, FLL) form of the Hubbard model interaction term.;32 Method-Procedure

The afterglow of a dusty plasma of rf discharge in argon is simulated by Particles In Cells-Monte Carlo Collisions (PIC-MCC) method.;31 Method-Specific
The experimental observation that heavy dust contamination of plasma leads to an anomalous increase in the electron density at the beginning of afterglow is explained by release of electrons from the dust surface.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
Under the assumption that the floating potential of particles is in equilibrium with plasma conditions, the fast cooling of electrons in afterglow plasma due to a rapid escape of hot electrons from the volume leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the floating potential and hence to a loss of charge by dust.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
The intensive desorption of electrons from nanoparticles is the origin of anomalous behavior of the electron density.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
At the next stage of afterglow, when the electrons become cool, the plasma decay is defined by ambipolar diffusion.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
The effect of metastable argon atoms is also considered.;42 Results-Reference
Additional ionization due to metastable atom collisions affects the electron temperature but does not change the behavior of the electron density qualitatively.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The same simulations are also made using an improved version of the previously suggested stochastic statistical method (SSM).;31 Method-Specific
The results obtained enable us to make a number of general conclusions about the dependences of the decomposition kinetics in Fe-Cu alloys on x and T.;42 Results-Reference
We also show that the SSM usually describes the precipitation kinetics in good agreement with the KMCM, and using the SSM in conjunction with the KMCM allows extending the KMC simulations to the longer evolution times.;42 Results-Reference
The results of simulations seem to agree with available experimental data for Fe-Cu alloys within statistical errors of simulations and the scatter of experimental results.;42 Results-Reference
Comparison of simulation results with experiments for some multicomponent Fe-Cu-based alloys allows making certain conclusions about the influence of alloying elements in these alloys on the precipitation kinetics at different stages of evolution.;53 Conclusions-Reference

The rate constants are evaluated for excitation of helium atoms in metastable states by electron impact if ionized helium is located in an external electric field and is supported by it, such that a typical electron energy is small compared to the atom excitation energy.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
Under these conditions, atom excitation is determined both by the electron traveling in the space of electron energies toward the excitation threshold and by the subsequent atom excitation, which is a self-consistent process because it leads to a sharp decrease in the energy distribution function of electrons, which in turn determines the excitation rate.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
The excitation rate constant is calculated for the regimes of low and high electron densities, and in the last case, it is small compared to the equilibrium rate constant where the Maxwell distribution function is realized including its tail.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
Quenching of metastable atom states by electron impact results in excitation of higher excited states, rather than transition to the ground electron state for the electric field strengths under consideration.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
Therefore, at restricted electron number densities, the rate of emission of resonant photons of the wavelength 58 nm, which results from the transition from the 21P state of the helium atom to the ground state, is close to the excitation rate of metastable atom states.;42 Results-Reference
The efficiency of atom excitation in ionized helium, i.e., the part of energy of an electric field injected in ionized helium that is spent on atom excitation, is evaluated.;42 Results-Reference
The results exhibit the importance of electron kinetics for an ionized gas located in an electric field.;53 Conclusions-Reference

We search for the long-term variability of the gamma-ray sky in the energy range E>1 GeV with 168 weeks of the gamma-ray telescope Fermi-LAT data.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
We perform a full sky blind search for regions with variable flux looking for deviations from uniformity.;32 Method-Procedure
We bin the sky into 12288 pixels using the HEALPIX package and use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare weekly photon counts in each pixel with the constant flux hypothesis.;31 Method-Specific, 32 Method-Procedure
The weekly exposure of Fermi-LAT for each pixel is calculated with the Fermi-LAT tools.;32 Method-Procedure
We consider flux variations in a pixel significant if the statistical probability of uniformity is less than 4• 10-6, which corresponds to 0.05 false detections in the whole set.;32 Method-Procedure
We identified 117 variable sources, 27 of which have not been reported variable before.;42 Results-Reference
The sources with previously unidentified variability contain 25 active galactic nuclei (AGN) belonging to the blazar class (11 BL Lacs and 14 FSRQs), one AGN of an uncertain type, and one pulsar PSR J0633+1746 (Geminga).;41 Results-Specific

At T=0 and a sufficiently large field, the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising chain undergoes a first-order spin-flop transition into the ferromagnetic phase.;2 Problem
We consider its smearing under the random-bond disorder such that all independent random bonds are antiferromagnetic (AF).;2 Problem
It is shown that the ground-state thermodynamics of this random AF chain can be described exactly for an arbitrary distribution P(J) of AF bonds.;42 Results-Reference
Moreover, the site magnetizations of finite chains can be found analytically in this model.;42 Results-Reference
We consider a continuous P(J) that is zero above some -J1 and behaves near it as (-J1-J)λ, λ>-1.;32 Method-Procedure
In this case, the ferromagnetic phase emerges continuously in a field H>Hc= 2J1.;41 Results-Specific
At 0>λ>-1, it has the usual second-order anomalies near Hc with the critical indices obeying the scaling relation and depending on λ.;41 Results-Specific
At λ>0, higher-order transitions occur (third, fourth, etc.), marked by a divergence of the corresponding nonlinear susceptibilities.;41 Results-Specific
In the chains with an even number of spins, the intermediate ``bow-tie'' phase with linearly modulated AF order exists between the AF and ferromagnetic phases at J1c.;41 Results-Specific
Its origin can be traced to the infinite correlation length of the degenerate AF phase from which it emerges.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
This implies the existence of similar inhomogeneous phases with size- and form-dependent order in a number of other systems with infinite correlation length.;52 Conclusions-Specific
The possibility to observe the signs of the ``bow-tie'' phase in low-T neutron diffraction experiments is discussed.;53 Conclusions-Reference

Phase behavior of DODAB aqueous solution, prepared without sonication, was studied by adiabatic scanning calorimetry.;31 Method-Specific
Measurements revealed four phase transitions with the temperatures 35.2, 39.6, 44.6, and 52.4 at heating and one transition at the temperature 40.4 at cooling.;41 Results-Specific
The first three transitions at heating occur in unilamellar vesicles.;42 Results-Reference
The first and third transitions correspond to the subgel-gel and gel-liquid phase transitions, corresponding enthalpy jumps are equal to 33 and 49 kJ/mol.;41 Results-Specific
The second transition appears after some aging and is similar to gel-ripple phase transition in a DPPC solution, with the enthalpy jump under the transition exceeding 7.4 kJ/mol.;41 Results-Specific
The transition occurs in unilamellar vesicles.;41 Results-Specific
The transition at the temperature 52.4 occurs in another subsystem of the solution, which we believe to be multilamellar vesicles.;41 Results-Specific
The enthalpy jump at this transition is equal to 97 kJ/mol, and data analysis suggests that this is a subgel-liquid transition.;41 Results-Specific
The phase transition at cooling is the liquid-gel transition in unilamellar vesicles.;41 Results-Specific
During the measurements, a slow evolution of the solution occurs, consisting in a change of concentrations of unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles.;41 Results-Specific
This transformation mainly occurs at low temperatures.;41 Results-Specific

The optical conductivity of graphene, bilayer graphene, and graphite in quantizing magnetic fields is studied.;2 Problem
Both dynamical conductivities, longitudinal and Hall's, are evaluated analytically.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
The conductivity peaks are explained in terms of electron transitions.;41 Results-Specific, 51 Conclusions-Explanation
Correspondences between the transition frequencies and the magneto-optical features are established using the theoretical results.;32 Method-Procedure
We show that trigonal warping can be considered within the perturbation theory for strong magnetic fields larger than 1 T.;42 Results-Reference
The semiclassical approach is applied for weak fields when the Fermi energy is much larger than the cyclotron frequency.;32 Method-Procedure
The main optical transitions obey the selection rule with Δ n=1 for the Landau number n, but the Δ n=2 transitions due to the trigonal warping are also possible.;41 Results-Specific
The Faraday/Kerr rotation and light transmission/reflection in quantizing magnetic fields are calculated.;42 Results-Reference
Parameters of the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure model are used in the fit taking the previous de Haas-van Alphen measurements into account and correcting some of them in the case of strong magnetic fields.;32 Method-Procedure

Basic equations of diffusional kinetics in alloys are statistically derived using the master equation approach.;31 Method-Specific, 42 Results-Reference
To describe diffusional transformations in substitution alloys, we derive the ``quasi-equilibrium'' kinetic equation that generalizes its earlier versions by taking possible ``interaction renormalization'' effects into account.;32 Method-Procedure
For the interstitial alloys Me-X, we derive an explicit expression for the diffusivity D of an interstitial atom X.;42 Results-Reference
This expression notably differs from those used in previous phenomenological treatments.;41 Results-Specific
This microscopic expression for D is applied to describe the diffusion of carbon in austenite based on some simple models of carbon-carbon interaction.;32 Method-Procedure
The results obtained enable us to make certain conclusions about the real form of these interactions and about the scale of the ``transition state entropy'' for diffusion of carbon in austenite.;53 Conclusions-Reference

The dc voltage observed at low temperatures in a 2D electron sample in the absence of noticeable external excitations [1] is accounted by the Schottky contact rectification of the noise generated in the measuring circuit.;32 Method-Procedure, 51 Conclusions-Explanation
The rectified voltage is shown to depend on the asymmetry of the contact pair.;42 Results-Reference
The dependence of the rectified voltage on the noise amplitude first follows the trivial quadratic law, then exhibits a nearly linear behavior, and finally, levels off.;41 Results-Specific

We suggest a qualitative explanation of oscillations in electron capture decays of hydrogen-like 140 Pr and 142 Pm ions observed recently in an ion experimental storage ring (ESR) of Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) mbH, Darmstadt, Germany.;2 Problem
This explanation is based on the electron multiphoton Rabi oscillations between two Zeeman states of the hyperfine ground level with the total angular momentum F=1/2.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
The Zeeman splitting is produced by a constant magnetic field in the ESR.;32 Method-Procedure
Transitions between these states are produced by the second, sufficiently strong alternating magnetic field that approximates realistic fields in the GSI ESR.;32 Method-Procedure
The Zeeman splitting amounts to only about 10-5 eV.;41 Results-Specific
This allows explaining the observed quantum beats with the period 7 s.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

We demonstrate that the tunneling current flowing through a system with Coulomb correlations leads to a charge redistribution between the different localized states.;42 Results-Reference
A simple model consisting of two electron levels is analyzed by means of the Heisenberg equations of motion taking correlations of electron filling numbers in localized states into account exactly in all orders.;31 Method-Specific
We consider various relations between the Coulomb interaction and localized electron energies.;32 Method-Procedure
Sudden jumps of the electron density at each level in a certain range of the applied bias are found.;42 Results-Reference
We find that for some parameter range, inverse occupation in the two-level system appears due to Coulomb correlations.;42 Results-Reference
It is also shown that Coulomb correlations lead to the appearance of negative tunneling conductivity at a certain relation between the values of tunneling rates from the two electron levels.;42 Results-Reference

An expansion of the nearly free-electron model constructed by Frantzeskakis, Pons, and Grioni [1] describing quantum states at the Bi/Si(111) interface with the giant spin-orbit coupling is developed and applied for the band structure and spin polarization calculation, as well as for the linear response analysis of the charge current and induced spin caused by a dc field and by electromagnetic radiation.;2 Problem
It is found that the large spin-orbit coupling in this system may allow resolving the spin-dependent properties even at room temperature and at a realistic collision rate.;42 Results-Reference
The geometry of the atomic lattice combined with spin-orbit coupling leads to an anisotropic response for both the current and spin components related to the orientation of the external field.;42 Results-Reference
The in-plane dc electric field produces only the in-plane components of spin in the sample, while both the in-plane and out-of-plane spin components can be excited by normally propagating electromagnetic wave with different polarizations.;42 Results-Reference

The new approach to the diffusion-limited reaction rate theory, recently proposed by the author, is further developed on the base of a similar approach to Brownian coagulation.;2 Problem
The traditional diffusion approach to calculation of the reaction rate is critically analyzed.;53 Conclusions-Reference
In particular, it is shown that the traditional approach is applicable only in the special case of reactions with a large reaction radius, \overline{r}_A\ll R_{AB}\ll\overline{r}_B (where \overline{r}_A and \overline{r}_B are the mean inter-particle distances), and becomes inappropriate in calculating the reaction rate in the case of a relatively small reaction radius, R_{AB}\ll\overline{r}_A,\overline{r}_B.;41 Results-Specific
In the latter case, most important for chemical reactions, particle collisions occur not in the diffusion regime but mainly in the kinetic regime characterized by homogeneous (random) spatial distribution of particles on the length scale of the mean inter-particle distance.;41 Results-Specific
The calculated reaction rate for a small reaction radius in three dimensions formally (and fortuitously) coincides with the expression derived in the traditional approach for reactions with a large reaction radius, but notably deviates at large times from the traditional result in the planar two-dimensional geometry.;41 Results-Specific
In application to reactions on discrete lattice sites, new relations for the reaction rate constants are derived for both three-dimensional and two-dimensional lattices.;42 Results-Reference

We theoretically study the electronic structure (spectral functions and Fermi surfaces) of incommensurate pseudogap and charge density wave (CDW) and commensurate CDW phases of quasi-two-dimensional diselenides 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-NbSe2.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
The incommensurate pseudogap regime is described within the scenario based on short-range-order CDW fluctuations, considered within the static Gaussian random field model.;42 Results-Reference
In contrast, e.g., to high-Tc cuprates, layered dichalcogenides have several different CDW scattering vectors and an electronic spectrum with two bands at the Fermi level.;42 Results-Reference
For this, we present a theoretical background for the description of multiple scattering processes within a multiple-band electronic spectrum.;32 Method-Procedure
Theoretical spectral functions and Fermi surfaces thus obtained are compared with recent ARPES experimental data, demonstrating rather good qualitative agreement.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference

Even tiny lepton flavor violation (LFV) due to some New Physics is able to alter the conditions inside a collapsing supernova core and probably to facilitate the explosion.;1 Background
LFV emerges naturally in a see-saw type-II model of neutrino mass generation.;1 Background
Experimentally, the LFV beyond the Standard Model is constrained by rare lepton decay searches.;1 Background
In particular, strong bounds are imposed on the \mu\rightarrow eee branching ratio and on the μ-e conversion in muonic gold.;1 Background
Currently, the \mu\rightarrow e \gamma is under investigation in the MEG experiment that aims at a dramatic increase in sensitivity in the next three years.;2 Problem
We seek a see-saw type-II LFV pattern that fits all the experimental constraints, leads to {\rm Br}(\mu\rightarrow e \gamma)\gtrsim {\rm Br}(\mu\rightarrow eee), and ensures a rate of LFV processes in supernova high enough to modify the supernova physics.;2 Problem
These requirements are sufficient to eliminate almost all freedom in the model.;2 Problem
In particular, they lead to the prediction 0.4 \cdot 10^{-12} \lesssim {\rm Br}(\mu\rightarrow e \gamma) \lesssim 6 \cdot 10^{-12}, which will be testable by MEG in the nearest future.;41 Results-Specific
The considered scenario also constrains the neutrino mass-mixing pattern and provides lower and upper bounds on τ-lepton LFV decays.;42 Results-Reference
We also briefly discuss a model with a single bilepton in which the \mu\rightarrow eee decay is absent at the tree level.;42 Results-Reference

We study the method of generation of states that approximate superpositions of large-amplitude coherent states (SCSs) with high fidelity in free-traveling fields.;2 Problem
Our approach is based on the representation of an arbitrary single-mode pure state, and SCSs in particular, in terms of displaced number states with an arbitrary displacement amplitude.;32 Method-Procedure
The proposed optical scheme is based on alternation of photon additions and displacement operators (in the general case, N photon additions and N-1 displacements are required) with a seed coherent state to generate both even and odd displaced squeezed SCSs regardless of the parity of the used photon additions.;42 Results-Reference
It is shown that the optical scheme studied is sensitive to the seed coherent state if the other parameters are unchanged.;42 Results-Reference
Output states can approximate either even squeezed SCS or odd SCS shifted relative to each other by some value.;42 Results-Reference
This allows constructing a local rotation operator, in particular, the Hadamard gate, which is a mainframe element for quantum computation with coherent states.;42 Results-Reference
We also show that three-photon additions with two intermediate displacement operators are sufficient to generate even displaced squeezed SCS with the amplitude 1.7 and fidelity more than 0.99.;42 Results-Reference
The effects deteriorating the quality of output states are considered.;42 Results-Reference

We suggest a new method of calculation of the equilibrium correlation functions of an arbitrary order for the interacting Fermi-gas model in the framework of the static fluctuation approximation method.;2 Problem
This method based only on a single and controllable approximation allows obtaining the so-called far-distance equations.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
These equations connecting the quantum states of a Fermi particle with variables of the local field operator contain all necessary information related to the calculation of the desired correlation functions and basic thermodynamic parameters of the many-body system.;42 Results-Reference
The basic expressions for the mean energy and heat capacity for the electron gas at low temperatures in the high-density limit were obtained.;42 Results-Reference
All expressions are given in the units of rs, where rs determines the ratio of a mean distance between electrons to the Bohr radius a0.;32 Method-Procedure
In these expressions, we calculate terms of the respective order rs and r2s.;42 Results-Reference
It is also shown that the static fluctuation approximation allows finding the terms related to higher orders of the decomposition with respect to the parameter rs.;42 Results-Reference

Different regimes of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) recurrence are simulated numerically for fully nonlinear ``one-dimensional'' potential water waves in a finite-depth flume between two vertical walls.;32 Method-Procedure
In such systems, the FPU recurrence is closely related to the dynamics of coherent structures approximately corresponding to solitons of the integrable Boussinesq system.;1 Background
A simplest periodic solution of the Boussinesq model, describing a single soliton between the walls, is presented in analytic form in terms of the elliptic Jacobi functions.;42 Results-Reference
In the numerical experiments, it is observed that depending on the number of solitons in the flume and their parameters, the FPU recurrence can occur in a simple or complicated manner, or be practically absent.;42 Results-Reference
For comparison, the nonlinear dynamics of potential water waves over nonuniform beds is simulated, with initial states taken in the form of several pairs of colliding solitons.;32 Method-Procedure
With a mild-slope bed profile, a typical phenomenon in the course of evolution is the appearance of relatively high (rogue) waves, while for random, relatively short-correlated bed profiles it is either the appearance of tall waves or the formation of sharp crests at moderate-height waves.;42 Results-Reference

We present a generalization of Borisov's construction of the chiral de Rham complex in the case of the line-bundle-twisted chiral de Rham complex on a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a projective space.;2 Problem
We generalize the differential associated with a polytope Δ of the projective space \mathbb{P}^{d- 1} by allowing nonzero modes for the screening currents forming this differential.;32 Method-Procedure
It is shown that the numbers of screening current modes define the support function of the toric divisor of a line bundle on \mathbb{P}^{d-1} that twists the chiral de Rham complex on the Calabi-Yau hypersurface.;42 Results-Reference

The \cN=1 SQCD with SU(Nc) colors and NF flavors of light quarks is considered within the dynamical scenario that assumes that quarks can be in the two different phases only: the heavy-quark phase, where they are confined, and the phase of higgsed quarks, at the appropriate values of the Lagrangian parameters.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
The mass spectra of this (direct) theory and its Seiberg dual are obtained and compared for quarks of small equal or unequal masses.;42 Results-Reference
It is shown that in those regions of the parameter space where an additional small parameter exists (it is 0<b_0/N_F=(3N_c-N_F)/N_F\ll 1 at the right end of the conformal window, where the direct theory is weakly coupled in the vicinity of its IR fixed point, or its analog 0<\overline{b}_0/N_F=(2N_F-3N_c)/N_F\ll 1 for the dual theory at the left end of the conformal window), the mass spectra of the direct and dual theories are parametrically different.;41 Results-Specific
A number of other regimes are also considered.;42 Results-Reference

Magnetic properties of the organic conductor κ-(BETS)2 Mn[N(CN)2]3 above and below the temperature of the metal-insulator transition that occurs at T_{MI}\approx25 K are studied by 1H NMR.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
The proton spectrum is shown to be determined by the static dipolar fields from Mn2+ localized moments, while the 1H spin-lattice relaxation is dominated by fluctuating fields from Mn2+ electrons.;42 Results-Reference
The NMR data, both static (the spectra) and dynamic (the spin-lattice relaxation), indicate the freezing of Mn2+ moments into a short-range or an incommensurate long-range antiferromagnetic order below TMI.;42 Results-Reference

The multiple quantum (MQ) NMR dynamics in the system of equivalent spins with the dipolar ordered initial state is considered.;42 Results-Reference
The high symmetry of the Hamiltonian responsible for the MQ NMR dynamics (the MQ Hamiltonian) is used to develop analytic and numerical methods for the investigation of the MQ NMR dynamics in systems consisting of hundreds of spins from the ``first principles''.;32 Method-Procedure
We obtain the dependence of the intensities of the MQ NMR coherences on their orders (profiles of the MQ NMR coherences) for systems of 200-600 spins.;42 Results-Reference
It is shown that these profiles may be well approximated by exponential distribution functions.;42 Results-Reference
We also compare the MQ NMR dynamics in the systems of equivalent spins having two different initial states, the dipolar ordered state and the thermal equilibrium state in a strong external magnetic field.;32 Method-Procedure

The energy spectra and transport of electronic excitations in one-dimensional aperiodic sequences of quantum dots of Thue-Morse and double-periodic type are studied.;2 Problem
The influence of external magnetic and electric fields on the energy spectra and transport is considered.;42 Results-Reference

In this approximation, all extremely sharp field-induced anomalies are described by analytic functions of temperature and the applied field.;32 Method-Procedure
In spite of the absence of true phase transitions, the analysis of the entropy and specific heat reliefs over the H-T plane allows discerning ``pseudo-phases'' with a specific character of spin fluctuations and defining the lines of relatively sharp ``pseudo-transitions'' between them.;42 Results-Reference

We investigate statistical properties of the passive scalar mixing in random (turbulent) flows assuming its diffusion to be weak.;2 Problem
Then at advanced stages of the passive scalar decay, its unmixed residue is primarily concentrated in a narrow diffusive layer near the wall and its transport to the bulk goes through the peripheral region (laminar sublayer of the flow).;42 Results-Reference
We conducted Lagrangian numerical simulations of the process for different space dimensions d and revealed structures responsible for the transport, which are passive scalar tongues pulled from the diffusive boundary layer to the bulk.;31 Method-Specific, 42 Results-Reference
We investigated statistical properties of the passive scalar and of the passive scalar integrated along the wall.;42 Results-Reference
Moments of both objects demonstrate scaling behavior outside the diffusive boundary layer.;42 Results-Reference
We propose an analytic scheme for the passive scalar statistics, explaining the features observed numerically.;42 Results-Reference

We investigate the photon emission from the electrosphere of a quark star.;2 Problem
We show that at temperatures T\approx 0.1-1 MeV, the dominating mechanism is the bremsstrahlung due to bending of electron trajectories in the mean Coulomb field of the electrosphere.;41 Results-Specific
The radiated energy for this mechanism is much larger than that for the Bethe-Heitler bremsstrahlung.;42 Results-Reference
The energy flux from the mean field bremsstrahlung also exceeds the one from the tunnel e+e- pair creation.;42 Results-Reference
We demonstrate that the LPM suppression of the photon emission is negligible.;42 Results-Reference

The high stiffness of the graphene body is provided by the benzenoid unit.;32 Method-Procedure
The anisotropy of the unit mechanical behavior in combination with different configurations of the unit packing with respect to the body C-C bond chains forms the ground for the structure-sensitive mechanism of the mechanical behavior that is drastically different for two different deformation modes.;32 Method-Procedure

An analytic approach to the theory of optical defect modes in chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) is developed.;2 Problem
The analytic study is facilitated by the choice of the problem parameters.;32 Method-Procedure
Specifically, an isotropic layer (with the dielectric susceptibility equal to the average CLC dielectric susceptibility) sandwiched between two CLC layers is studied.;42 Results-Reference
The chosen model allows eliminating the polarization mixing and reducing the corresponding equations to the equations for light of diffracting polarization only.;42 Results-Reference
The dispersion equation relating the defect mode (DM) frequency to the isotropic layer thickness and an analytic expression for the field distribution in the DM structure are obtained and the corresponding dependences are plotted for some values of the DM structure parameters.;42 Results-Reference
Analytic expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients of the DM structure (CLC-defect layer-CLC) are presented and analyzed for nonabsorbing, absorbing, and amplifying CLCs.;42 Results-Reference
The anomalously strong light absorption effect at the DM frequency is revealed.;42 Results-Reference
The limit case of infinitely thick CLC layers is considered in detail.;42 Results-Reference
It is shown that for distributed feedback lasing in a defect structure, adjusting the lasing frequency to the DM frequency results in a significant decrease in the lasing threshold.;42 Results-Reference
The DM dispersion equations are solved numerically for typical values of the relevant parameters.;42 Results-Reference
