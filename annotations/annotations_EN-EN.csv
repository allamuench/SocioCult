The transport of the potential vorticity gradient $\bnabla{q}$ along surfaces of constant temperature Î¸ is investigated for the stratified Euler , Navier-Stokes and hydrostatic primitive equations of the oceans and atmosphere using the divergenceless flux vector $\bdB = \bnabla Q( q )\times\bnabla\theta$ , for any smooth function Q(q) .;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
The flux $\bdB$ is shown to satisfy \partial_t\bdB - {curl} ( \bU\times\bdB ) = - \bnabla\big[qQ'( q ) {div} \bU\big]\times\bnabla\theta ,where $\bU$ is a formal transport velocity of PV flux .;41 Results-Specific
While the left hand side of this expression is reminiscent of the frozen-in magnetic field flux in magnetohydrodynamics , the non-zero right hand side means that $\bdB] is not frozen into the flow of $\bU$ when ${div} \bU \neq 0$ .;51 Conclusions-Explanation
The result may apply to measurements of potential vorticity and potential temperature at the tropopause .;52 Conclusions-Specific

In cold molecular clouds submillimetre emission lines are excited by the ambient radiation field .;1 Background
The pumping is dominated by the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .;1 Background
It is usual in molecular line radiative transfer modelling to simply assume that this is the only incident radiation field .;1 Background
In this paper, a molecular line transport code and a dust radiative transfer code are used to explore the effects of the inclusion of a full interstellar radiation field (ISRF) on a simple test molecular cloud .;2 Problem
It is found that in many galactic situations , the shape and strength of the line profiles that result are robust to variations in the ISRF and thus that in most cases , it is safe to adopt the CMB radiation field for the molecular line transport calculations .;42 Results-Reference, 52 Conclusions-Specific
However , we show that in two examples , the inclusion of a plausible radiation field can have a significant effect on the line profiles .;42 Results-Reference
Firstly , in the vicinity of an embedded massive star , there will be an enhanced far infared component to the radiation field .;41 Results-Specific
Secondly , for molecular clouds at large redshift , the CMB temperature increases and this of course also alters the radiation field .;41 Results-Specific
In both of these cases , the line profiles are weakened significantly compared to a cloud exposed to a standard radiation field .;41 Results-Specific
Therefore this effect should be accounted for when investigating prestellar cores in massive star forming regions and when searching for molecular clouds at high redshift .;52 Conclusions-Specific

We derive absolute dimensions of the early B-type detached eclipsing binary V453 Cygni (B0.4 IV + B0.7 IV, P=3.89d), a member of the open cluster NGC 6871.;2 Problem
From the analysis of new, high-resolution, spectroscopy and the UBV light curves of Cohen (1974) we find the masses to be 14.36 +/- 0.20 and 11.11 +/- 0.13 Msun, the radii to be 8.55 +/- 0.06 and 5.49 +/- 0.06 Rsun, and   the effective temperatures to be 26600 +/- 500 and 25 500 +/- 800 K for the primary and secondary stars, respectively.;31 Method-Specific, 41 Results-Specific
The surface gravities of 3.731 +/- 0.012 and 4.005 +/- 0.015 indicate that V453 Cyg is reaching the end of its main sequence lifetime.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
We have determined the apsidal motion period of the system to be 66.4 +/- 1.8 yr using the technique of Lacy (1992) extended to include spectroscopic data as well as times of minimum light, giving a density concentration coefficient of log(k_2) = -2.226 +/- 0.024.;31 Method-Specific, 41 Results-Specific
Contaminating (third) light has been detected for the first time in the light curve of V453 Cyg, previous analyses without this effect systematically underestimate the ratio of the radii of the two stars.;2 Problem, 41 Results-Specific
The absolute dimensions of the system have been compared to the stellar evolution models of the Granada, Geneva, Padova and Cambridge groups.;42 Results-Reference
All model sets fit the data on V453 Cyg for solar helium and metal abundances and an age of 10.0 +/- 0.2 Myr.;41 Results-Specific
The Granada models also agree fully with the observed log(k_2) once general relativistic effects have been accounted for.;41 Results-Specific
The Cambridge models with convective core overshooting fit V453 Cyg better than those without.;41 Results-Specific
Given this success of the theoretical predictions, we briefly discuss which eclipsing binaries should be studied in order to further challenge the models.;53 Conclusions-Reference

We report the discovery of only the fourth massive WO star to be found in the Milky Way, and only the seventh identified within the Local Group.;41 Results-Specific
This has resulted from the first observations made in a programme of follow-up spectroscopy of candidate emission line stars from the AAO/UK Schmidt Southern Galactic Plane H-alpha Survey.;32 Method-Procedure
The optical spectrum of this star, to become WR 93b in the Catalogue of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, is presented and described.;42 Results-Reference
WR 93b is classified as WO3 and is shown to be highly reddened (E(B-V) = 2.1 pm 0.1).;41 Results-Specific
A recombination line analysis of the emission lines yields the abundance ratios C/He = 0.95 and O/He = 0.13 (by number).;41 Results-Specific
Comparisons at near infrared wavelengths of reddening corrected photometry between WR 93b and both of Sand 2 (WO3, D = 49 kpc) and Sand 5 (WO2, D = 1.75 kpc) yields a consistent distance to WR 93b of 3.4 kpc.;41 Results-Specific
Positioned at Galactic co-ordinates l = 353.27, b = -0.85, the star is most likely located in the Scutum-Crux Arm of the inner Milky Way.;41 Results-Specific
We note that none of the four Galactic WO stars lies significantly beyond the Solar Circle (with two well inside).;41 Results-Specific
Estimation of the wind terminal velocity in WR 93b at 5750 km/s makes this star the current wind speed record holder among all non-degenerate stars.;41 Results-Specific

We present the final catalogue of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ), based on Anglo-Australian Telescope 2dF spectroscopic observations of 44576 colour-selected (u b_J r) objects with 18.25<b_J<20.85 selected from APM scans of UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) photographic plates.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
The 2QZ comprises 23338 QSOs, 12292 galactic stars (including 2071 white dwarfs) and 4558 compact narrow-emission-line galaxies.;41 Results-Specific
We obtained a reliable spectroscopic identification for 86 per cent of objects observed with 2dF.;41 Results-Specific
We also report on the 6dF QSO Redshift Survey (6QZ), based on UKST 6dF observations of 1564 brighter 16<b_J<18.25 sources selected from the same photographic input catalogue.;42 Results-Reference
In total, we identified 322 QSOs spectroscopically in the 6QZ.;41 Results-Specific
The completed 2QZ is, by more than a factor 50, the largest homogeneous QSO catalogue ever constructed at these faint limits (b_J<20.85) and high QSO surface densities (5 QSOs deg^-2).;41 Results-Specific
As such it represents an important resource in the study of the Universe at moderate-to-high redshifts.;52 Conclusions-Specific
As an example of the results possible with the 2QZ, we also present our most recent analysis of the optical QSO luminosity function and its cosmological evolution with redshift.;42 Results-Reference
For a flat, Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lam=0.7, Universe, we find that a double power law with luminosity evolution that is exponential in look-back time, t, of the form L*(z) exp(6.15t), equivalent to an e-folding time of 2Gyr, provides an acceptable fit to the redshift dependence of the QSO luminosity function over the range [0.4 < z < 2.1 and M_bJ<-22.5.;41 Results-Specific
Evolution described by a quadratic in redshift is also an acceptable fit, with L*(z)~10^(1.39z-0.29z^2).;41 Results-Specific

We derive absolute dimensions for two early-type main sequence detached eclipsing binaries in the young open cluster h Persei (NGC 869).;2 Problem
V615 Persei has a spectral type of B7V and a period of 13.7d.;41 Results-Specific
V618 Persei is A2V and has a period of 6.4d.;41 Results-Specific
New ephemerides are calculated for both systems.;42 Results-Reference
The masses of the component stars have been derived using high-resolution spectroscopy and are 4.08+/-0.06 Msun and 3.18+/-0.05 Msun for V615 Per and 2.33+/-0.03 Msun and 1.56+/-0.02] Msun for V618 Per.;31 Method-Specific, 41 Results-Specific
The radii have been measured by fitting the available light curves using EBOP and are 2.29+/-0.14] Rsun and 1.90+/-0.09 Rsun for V615 Per and 1.64+/-0.07 Rsun and 1.32+/-0.07 Rsun for V618 Per.;31 Method-Specific, 41 Results-Specific
By comparing the observed spectra of V615 Per to synthetic spectra from model atmospheres we find that the effective temperatures of the two stars are 15000+/-500 K and 11000+/-500 K.;32 Method-Procedure, 41 Results-Specific
The equatorial rotational velocities of the primary and secondary components of V615 Per are 28+/-5 km/s and 8+/-5 km/s, respectively.;41 Results-Specific
Both components of V618 Per rotate at 10+/-5 km/s.;41 Results-Specific
The equatorial rotational velocities for synchronous rotation are about 10 km/s for all four stars.;41 Results-Specific
The timescales for orbital circularisation for both systems, and the timescale for rotational synchronisation of V615 Per, are much greater than the age of h Per.;41 Results-Specific
Their negligible eccentricities and equatorial rotational velocities therefore support the hypothesis that they were formed by 'delayed breakup'.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
We have compared the radii of these stars to models by the Granada and the Padova groups for stars of the same masses but different compositions.;32 Method-Procedure
We conclude that the metallicity of the stars is about Z=0.01.;41 Results-Specific
This appears to be the first estimate of the bulk metallicity of h Per.;52 Conclusions-Specific
Recent photometric studies have assumed a solar metallicity so their results should be reviewed.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We develop new methods to study the properties of galaxy redshift surveys and radial peculiar velocity surveys, both individually and combined.;2 Problem
We derive the Fisher information matrix for redshift surveys, including redshift distortions and stochastic bias.;42 Results-Reference
We find exact results for estimating the marginalised accuracy of a two-parameter measurement of the amplitude of galaxy clustering, A_g, and the distortion parameter beta.;42 Results-Reference
The Fisher matrix is also derived for a radial peculiar velocity survey and we discuss optimisation of these surveys for equal timescales.;42 Results-Reference
The Fisher Super-Matrix, combining both surveys, is derived.;42 Results-Reference
We apply these results to investigate the 6 degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), currently underway on the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST).;32 Method-Procedure
The survey will consist of approximately 125000 K-band selected galaxies with redshifts and a subset of around 5000 galaxies with radial peculiar velocities.;32 Method-Procedure
We find for the redshift survey that we can measure the three parameters A_g, Gamma and beta to about 3% accuracy, but will not be able to detect the baryon abundance, or the matter-galaxy correlation coefficient, r_g.;41 Results-Specific
The peculiar velocity survey will jointly measure the velocity amplitude A_v and Gamma to around 25% accuracy.;41 Results-Specific
A conditional estimate of the amplitude A_v alone, can be made to 5%.;41 Results-Specific
When the surveys are combined however, the major degeneracy between beta and r_g is lifted and we are able to measure A_g, Gamma, beta and r_g all to the 2% level, significantly improving on current estimates.;41 Results-Specific
Finally we consider scale dependence of r_g and the biassing parameter b.;42 Results-Reference
We find that measurements for these averaged over logarithmic passbands can be constrained to the level of a few percent.;41 Results-Specific

Mass outflows from Eddington-limited accreting compact objects appear to be a very widespread phenomenon.;1 Background
They may provide the soft excess observed in quasars and ULXs, and imply that such objects have a major effect on their surroundings.;1 Background
In particular they allow a simple parameter-free argument for the M_BH-sigma relation for galaxies, and offer a straightforward interpretation of the emission nebulae seen around ULXs.;42 Results-Reference

We have surveyed four globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf galaxy for RR Lyrae stars, using archival HST observations.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
We identify 197 new RR Lyrae stars in these four clusters.;41 Results-Specific
Despite the short observational baseline, we derive periods, light-curves, and photometric parameters for each.;42 Results-Reference
The Fornax clusters have exceptionally large RR Lyrae specific frequencies compared with the Galactic globular clusters.;41 Results-Specific
Furthermore, the Fornax cluster RR Lyrae stars are unusual in that their characteristics are intermediate between the two Galactic Oosterhoff groups.;41 Results-Specific
In this respect the Fornax clusters are similar to the field populations in several dwarf galaxies.;41 Results-Specific
We revise previous measurements of the HB morphology in each cluster.;42 Results-Reference
The Fornax clusters closely resemble the ''young'' Galactic halo population defined by Zinn.;41 Results-Specific
The existence of the second parameter effect among the Fornax clusters is also confirmed.;41 Results-Specific
Finally, we determine foreground reddening and distance estimates for each cluster.;42 Results-Reference
We find a mean distance modulus to Fornax of (m-M)_0 = 20.66 +/- 0.03 (random) +/- 0.15 (systematic).;41 Results-Specific
Our measurements are consistent with a line of sight depth of 8-10 kpc for this galaxy, matching its projected dimensions, and incompatible with tidal model explanations for the observed high velocity dispersions in many dSph galaxies.;52 Conclusions-Specific
Dark matter dominance is suggested.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

I discuss how parameters describing inflation in the very early universe may be related to primordial perturbation spectra. ;2 Problem
Precision observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) such as those provided by the WMAP satellite offer an unprecedented window onto the physics of the very early universe.;1 Background
To theorists exploring speculative models of physics at high energies, the CMB offers us the chance to put our ideas to the test.;53 Conclusions-Reference

We demonstrate how to produce a stable multispeed lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for a wide range of velocity sets, many of which were previously thought to be intrinsically unstable.;2 Problem
We use non-Gauss-Hermitian cubatures.;31 Method-Specific
The method operates stably for almost zero viscosity, has second-order accuracy, suppresses typical spurious oscillation (only a modest Gibbs effect is present) and introduces no artificial viscosity.;41 Results-Specific
There is almost no computational cost for this innovation.;41 Results-Specific
12;
We revisit the classical stability versus accuracy dilemma for the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM).;2 Problem
Our goal is a stable method of second-order accuracy for fluid dynamics based on the lattice Bhatnager-Gross-Krook method (LBGK).;2 Problem
The LBGK scheme can be recognised as a discrete dynamical system generated by free-flight and entropic involution.;1 Background
In this framework the stability and accuracy analysis are more natural.;Unknown
We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for second-order accurate fluid dynamics modelling.;42 Results-Reference
In particular, it is proven that in order to guarantee second-order accuracy the distribution should belong to a distinguished surface - the invariant film (up to second-order in the time step).;41 Results-Specific
This surface is the trajectory of the (quasi)equilibrium distribution surface under free-flight.;
The main instability mechanisms are identified.;42 Results-Reference
The simplest recipes for stabilisation add no artificial dissipation (up to second-order) and provide second-order accuracy of the method.;41 Results-Specific
Two other prescriptions add some artificial dissipation locally and prevent the system from loss of positivity and local blow-up.;41 Results-Specific
Demonstration of the proposed stable LBGK schemes are provided by the numerical simulation of a 1D shock tube and the unsteady 2D-flow around a square-cylinder (up to Reynolds number 10000).;32 Method-Procedure

We examine the feasibility of predicting and subsequently managing the future evolution of a Complex Adaptive System.;2 Problem
Our archetypal system mimics a competitive population of mechanical, biological, informational or human objects.;32 Method-Procedure
We show that short-term prediction yields corridors along which the system will, with very high probability, evolve.;42 Results-Reference
We then show how small amounts of 'population engineering' can be undertaken in order to steer the system away from any undesired regimes which have been predicted.;2 Problem
Despite the system's many degrees of freedom and inherent stochasticity, this dynamical 'soft' control over future risk requires only minimal knowledge about the population's composition.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We introduce a Hubbard model on a particular class of geometries, and consider the effect of doping the highly spin-degenerate Mott-insulating state with a microscopic number of holes in the extreme strong-coupling limit.;2 Problem
The geometry is quite general, with pairs of atomic sites at each superlattice vertex, and a highly frustrated inter-atomic connectivity: the one dimensional realization is a chain of edge-sharing tetrahedra.;41 Results-Specific
The sole model parameter is the ratio of intra-pair to inter-pair hopping matrix elements.;41 Results-Specific
If the intra-pair hopping is negligible then introducing a microscopic number of holes results in a ferromagnetic Nagaoka groundstate.;41 Results-Specific
Conversely, if the intra-pair hopping is comparable with the inter-pair hopping then the groundstate is low spin with short-ranged spin correlations.;41 Results-Specific
We exactly solve the correlated motion of a pair of holes in such a state and find that, in 1-d and 2-d, they form a bound pair on a length scale that increases with diminishing binding energy.;41 Results-Specific
This result is pertinent to the long-standing problem of hole motion in the copper-oxide planes of the high-temperature superconductors: we have rigorously shown that, on our frustrated geometry, the holes pair up and a short-ranged low-spin state is generated by hole motion alone.;41 Results-Specific
15;
We discuss electron scattering in a one-dimensional delta barrier potential with either time-dependent coupling constant (classical model) or a coupling constant that is linear in a boson coordinate (quantum model).;2 Problem
We find an exact continued fraction solution and Fano like resonances in the transmission coefficient.;42 Results-Reference
In the quantum model, energies for perfect transmission exist below the first sideband threshold.;41 Results-Specific
16;
In very anisotropic layered superconductors (e.g. Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox) a tilted magnetic field can penetrate as two co-existing lattices of vortices parallel and perpendicular to the layers.;1 Background
At low out-of-plane fields the perpendicular vortices form a set of isolated vortex chains, which have recently been observed in detail with scanning Hall-probe measurements.;1 Background
We present calculations that show a very delicate stability of this isolated-chain state.;2 Problem
As the vortex density increases along the chain there is a first-order transition to a buckled chain, and then the chain will expel vortices in a continuous transition to a composite-chain state.;42 Results-Reference
At low densities there is an instability towards clustering, due to a long-range attraction between the vortices on the chain, and at very low densities it becomes energetically favorable to form a tilted chain, which may explain the sudden disappearance of vortices along the chains seen in recent experiments.;42 Results-Reference

We describe the Sr optical lattice clock apparatus at NPL with particular emphasis on techniques used to increase reliability and minimise the human requirement in its operation.;2 Problem
Central to this is a clock-referenced transfer cavity scheme for the stabilisation of cooling and trapping lasers.;32 Method-Procedure
We highlight several measures to increase the reliability of the clock with a view towards the realisation of an optical time-scale.;42 Results-Reference
The clock contributed 502 hours of data over a 25 day period (84% uptime) in a recent measurement campaign with several uninterrupted periods of more than 48 hours.;41 Results-Specific
An instability of 2Ã10â17 was reached after 105 s of averaging in an interleaved self-comparison of the clock.;41 Results-Specific

We develop a method of modified hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks, achieving complete immunity to the frequency shifts induced by the probing fields themselves.;2 Problem
Using particular pulse sequences with tailored phases, frequencies, and durations, we can derive an error signal centered exactly at the unperturbed atomic resonance with a steep discriminant which is robust against variations in the probe shift.;32 Method-Procedure
We experimentally investigate the scheme using the magnetically-induced 1S0â3P0 transition in 88Sr, demonstrating automatic suppression of a sizeable \num{2e-13} probe Stark shift to below \num{1e-16} even with very large errors in shift compensation.;32 Method-Procedure, 41 Results-Specific

We report on the design and testing of an array of Penning ion traps made from printed circuit board.;2 Problem
The system enables fast shuttling of ions from one trapping zone to another, which could be of use in quantum information processing.;52 Conclusions-Specific
We describe simulations carried out to determine the optimal potentials to be applied to the trap electrodes for enabling this movement.;42 Results-Reference
The results of a preliminary experiment with a cloud of laser cooled calcium ions demonstrate a round-trip shuttling efficiency of up to 75%.;41 Results-Specific

We present a solid-state laser system that generates over 200 mW of continuous-wave, narrowband light, tunable from 316.3 nm - 17.7 nm and 318.0 nm - 319.3 nm.;2 Problem, 41 Results-Specific
The laser is based on commercially available fiber amplifiers and optical frequency doubling technology, along with sum frequency generation in a periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate crystal.;Unknown
The laser frequency is stabilized to an atomic-referenced high finesse optical transfer cavity.;32 Method-Procedure
Using a GPS-referenced optical frequency comb we measure a long term frequency instability of <35 kHz for timescales between 10â3 s and 103 s.;31 Method-Specific
As an application we perform spectroscopy of Sr Rydberg states from n = 37 - 81, demonstrating mode-hop-free scans of 24 GHz.;32 Method-Procedure, 41 Results-Specific
In a cold atomic sample we measure Doppler-limited linewidths of 350 kHz.;41 Results-Specific

We describe a simple strontium vapor cell for laser spectroscopy experiments.;2 Problem
Strontium vapor is produced using an electrically heated commercial dispenser source.;32 Method-Procedure
The sealed cell operates at room temperature, and without a buffer gas or vacuum pump.;32 Method-Procedure
The cell was characterised using laser spectroscopy, and was found to offer stable and robust operation, with an estimated lifetime of 10,000 hours.;31 Method-Specific, 41 Results-Specific
By changing the dispenser, this technique can be readily extended to other alkali and alkaline earth elements.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We report modulation transfer spectroscopy on the D2 transitions in 85Rb and 87Rb using a simple home-built electro-optic modulator (EOM).;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
We show that both the gradient and amplitude of modulation transfer spectroscopy signals, for the 87Rb F=2 to F'=3 and the 85Rb F=3 to F'=4 transitions, can be significantly enhanced by expanding the beams, improving the signals for laser frequency stabilization.;42 Results-Reference
The signal gradient for these transitions is increased by a factor of 3 and the peak to peak amplitude was increased by a factor of 2.;41 Results-Specific
The modulation transfer signal for the 85Rb F=2 to F' transitions is also presented to highlight how this technique can generate a single, clear line for laser frequency stabilization even in cases where there are a number of closely spaced hyperfine transitions.;42 Results-Reference

Atom interferometric sensors and quantum information processors must maintain coherence while the evolving quantum wavefunction is split, transformed and recombined, but suffer from experimental inhomogeneities and uncertainties in the speeds and paths of these operations.;2 Problem
Several error-correction techniques have been proposed to isolate the variable of interest.;2 Problem
Here we apply composite pulse methods to velocity-sensitive Raman state manipulation in a freely-expanding thermal atom cloud.;31 Method-Specific
We compare several established pulse sequences, and follow the state evolution within them.;32 Method-Procedure
The agreement between measurements and simple predictions shows the underlying coherence of the atom ensemble, and the inversion infidelity in an 80 micro-Kelvin atom cloud is halved.;41 Results-Specific
Composite pulse techniques, especially if tailored for atom interferometric applications, should allow greater interferometer areas, larger atomic samples and longer interaction times, and hence improve the sensitivity of quantum technologies from inertial sensing and clocks to quantum information processors and tests of fundamental physics.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Frauchiger and Renner have recently claimed to prove that âSingle-world interpretations of quantum theory cannot be self-consistentâ.;1 Background
This is contradicted by a construction due to Bell, inspired by Bohmian mechanics, which shows that any quantum system can be modelled in such a way that there is only one âworldâ at any time, but the predictions of quantum theory are reproduced.;2 Problem
This BellâBohmian theory is applied to the experiment proposed by Frauchiger and Renner, and their argument is critically examined.;53 Conclusions-Reference
It is concluded that it is their version of âstandard quantum theoryâ, incorporating state vector collapse upon measurement, that is not self-consistent.;53 Conclusions-Reference

A problem in nonlinear water-wave propagation on the surface of an inviscid, stationary fluid is presented.;2 Problem
"The primary surface wave, suitably initiated at some radius, is taken to be a slowly evolving nonlinear cylindrical wave (governed by an appropriate Korteweg-de Vries equation), the depth is assumed to be varying in a purely radial direction.";32 Method-Procedure
We consider a $\sech^2$ profile at an initial radius (which is, following our scalings, rather large), and we describe the evolution as it propagates radially outwards.;32 Method-Procedure
This initial profile was chosen because its evolution over constant depth is understood both analytically and numerically, even though it is not an exact solitary-wave solution of the cylindrical KdV equation.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
The propagation process will introduce reflected and re-reflected components which will also be described.;42 Results-Reference
The precise nature of these reflections is fixed by the requirements of mass conservation.;42 Results-Reference
The asymptotic results presented describe the evolution of the primary wave, the development of an outward shelf and also an inward (reflected) shelf.;42 Results-Reference
These results make use of specific depth variations (which were chosen to simplify the solution of the relevant equations), and mirror those obtained for the problem of 1-D plane waves over variable depth, although the details here are more complex due to the axi-symmetry.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

In this paper we discuss Airy solutions of the second Painleve equation (\mbox{\rm PII}) and two related equations, the Painleve XXXIV equation (\rm P34) and the Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto Ï form of \mbox{\rm PII}\ (\mbox{\rm SII}), are discussed.;2 Problem
It is shown that solutions which depend only on the Airy function Ai(z) have a completely difference structure to those which involve a linear combination of the Airy functions Ai(z) and Bi(z).;42 Results-Reference
For all three equations, the special solutions which depend only on Ai(t) are tronquee solutions, i.e. they have no poles in a sector of the complex plane.;41 Results-Specific
Further for both \rm P34\ and \mbox{\rm SII}, it is shown that amongst these tronquee solutions there is a family of solutions which have no poles on the real axis.;41 Results-Specific

Exact solutions of the dispersive and modified equations are expressed in terms of special polynomials associated with rational solutions of the fourth Painleve equation, which arises as generalized scaling reductions of these equations.;42 Results-Reference

The relationship between point vortex dynamics and the properties of polynomials with roots at the vortex positions is discussed.;2 Problem
Classical polynomials, such as the Hermite polynomials, have roots that describe the equilibria of identical vortices on the line.;42 Results-Reference
Stationary and uniformly translating vortex configurations with vortices of the same strength but positive or negative orientation are given by the zeros of the Adler-Moser polynomials, which arise in the description of rational solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.;41 Results-Specific
For quadupole background flow, vortex configurations are given by the zeros of polynomials expressed as wronskians of Hermite polynomials.;41 Results-Specific
Further new solutions are found in this case using the special polynomials arising the in the description of rational solutions of the fourth Painleve equation.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference

In this paper, we examine a generalized magma equation for rational values of two parameters, m and n.;2 Problem
Firstly, the similarity reductions are found using the Lie group method of infinitesimal transformations.;31 Method-Specific, 41 Results-Specific
The Painleve ODE test is then applied to the travelling wave reduction, and the pairs of m and n which pass the test are identified.;32 Method-Procedure
These particular pairs are further subjected to the ODE test on their other symmetry reductions.;32 Method-Procedure
Only two cases remain which pass the ODE test for all such symmetry reductions and these are completely integrable.;42 Results-Reference
The case when m=0, n=â1 is related to the Hirota-Satsuma equation and for m=12, n=â12, it is a real, generalized, pumped Maxwell-Bloch equation.;41 Results-Specific

The hydrostatic primitive equations (HPE) form the basis of most numerical weather, climate and global ocean circulation models.;1 Background
Analytical (not statistical) methods are used to find a scaling proportional to (NuRaRe) 1/4 for the range of horizontal spatial sizes in HPE solutions, which is much broader than currently achievable computationally.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
The range of scales for the HPE is determined from an analytical bound on the time-averaged enstrophy of the horizontal circulation.;32 Method-Procedure
This bound allows the formation of very small spatial scales, whose existence would excite unphysically large linear oscillation frequencies and gravity wave speeds.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Recent experiments have shown that many species of microorganisms leave a solid surface at a fixed angle determined by steric interactions and near-field hydrodynamics.;1 Background
This angle is completely independent of the incoming angle.;1 Background
For several collisions in a closed body this determines a unique type of billiard system, an aspecular billiard in which the outgoing angle is fixed for all collisions;1 Background
We analyze such a system using numerical simulation of this billiard for varying tables and outgoing angles, and also utilize the theory of one-dimensional maps and wavefront dynamics;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
When applicable we cite results from and compare our system to similar billiard systems in the literature.;32 Method-Procedure
We focus on examples from three broad classes: the ellipse, the Bunimovich billiards, and the Sinai billiards.;32 Method-Procedure
The effect of a noisy outgoing angle is also discussed.;42 Results-Reference

Dynamical collapse models embody the idea of a physical collapse of the wave function in a mathematically well-defined way.;1 Background
They involve modifications to the standard rules of quantum theory in order to describe collapse as a physical process;1 Background
This appears to introduce a time reversal asymmetry into the dynamics since the state at any given time depends on collapses in the past but not in the future;2 Problem
Here we challenge this conclusion by demonstrating that, subject to specified model constraints, collapse models can be given a structurally time symmetric formulation in which the collapse events are the primitive objects of the theory;2 Problem
Three different examples of time asymmetries associated with collapse models are then examined and in each case it is shown that the same dynamical rule determining the collapse events works in both the forward and backward in time directions;42 Results-Reference
Any physically observed time asymmetries that arise in such models are due to the asymmetric imposition of initial or final time boundary conditions, rather than from an inherent asymmetry in the dynamical law;51 Conclusions-Explanation
This is the standard explanation of time asymmetric behaviour resulting from time symmetric laws.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

The focusing of spin waves in magnetic materials has a number of important advantages for directing energy and thus information.;1 Background
In contrast to earlier works, we theoretically calculate the focusing of short-wavelength spin waves.;2 Problem
We show that strong focusing of large wave-vector spin waves naturally occurs about halfway out in the Brillouin zone with no need for a magnetocrystalline anisotropy, dipolar effects, or an external magnetic field.;42 Results-Reference
The fact that the wavelength is on the order of the lattice constant leads to a form of lattice-induced anisotropy in the wave propagation.;42 Results-Reference
We also explore the tunability that is achieved by the application of both an external field and a uniaxial anisotropy.;2 Problem
In this case there is a rotation of the focusing pattern.;41 Results-Specific
The rotation angle can be changed by varying the field strength, demonstrating tunability.;42 Results-Reference

Proposed models of closed timelike curves (CTCs) have been shown to enable powerful information-processing protocols.;1 Background
We examine the simulation of models of CTCs both by other models of CTCs and by physical systems without access to CTCs;2 Problem
We prove that the recently proposed transition probability CTCs (T-CTCs) are physically equivalent to postselection CTCs (P-CTCs), in the sense that one model can simulate the other with reasonable overhead;2 Problem
As a consequence, their information-processing capabilities are equivalent;42 Results-Reference
We also describe a method for quantum computers to simulate Deutschian CTCs (but with a reasonable overhead only in some cases);42 Results-Reference
In cases for which the overhead is reasonable, it might be possible to perform the simulation in a table-top experiment;52 Conclusions-Specific
This approach has the benefit of resolving some ambiguities associated with the equivalent circuit model of Ralph et al.;52 Conclusions-Specific
Furthermore, we provide an explicit form for the state of the CTC system such that it is a maximum-entropy state, as prescribed by Deutsch.;42 Results-Reference

The additional information within a HamiltonâJacobi representation of quantum mechanics is extra, in general, to the SchrÃ¶dinger representation.;1 Background
This additional information specifies the microstate of Ï that is incorporated into the quantum reduced action, W.;1 Background
Non-physical solutions of the quantum stationary HamiltonâJacobi equation for energies that are not Hamiltonian eigenvalues are examined to establish Lipschitz continuity of the quantum reduced action and conjugate momentum.;2 Problem
Milne quantization renders the eigenvalue J.;41 Results-Specific
Eigenvalues J and E mutually imply each other.;41 Results-Specific
Jacobiâs theorem generates a microstate-dependent time parametrization tâÏ=âEW even where energy, E, and action variable, J, are quantized eigenvalues.;41 Results-Specific
Substantiating examples are examined in a HamiltonâJacobi representation including the linear harmonic oscillator numerically and the square well in closed form.;32 Method-Procedure
Two byproducts are developed.;42 Results-Reference
First, the monotonic behavior of W is shown to ease numerical and analytic computations.;41 Results-Specific
Second, a HamiltonâJacobi representation, quantum trajectories, is shown to develop the standard energy quantization formulas of wave mechanics.;41 Results-Specific

A quantum state represents neither properties of a physical system nor anyoneâs knowledge of its properties.;1 Background
The important question is not what quantum states represent but how they are usedâas informational bridges.;1 Background
Knowing about some physical situations (its backing conditions), an agent may assign a quantum state to form expectations about other possible physical situations (its advice conditions).;1 Background
Quantum states are objective: only expectations based on correct state assignments are generally reliable.;1 Background
If a quantum state represents anything, it is the objective probabilistic relations between its backing conditions and its advice conditions.;1 Background
This paper offers an account of quantum states and their function as informational bridges, in quantum teleportation and elsewhere.;2 Problem

A Lagrangian formulation is constructed for particle interpretations of quantum mechanics, a well-known example of such an interpretation being the Bohm model.;42 Results-Reference
The advantages of such a description are that the equations for particle motion, field evolution and conservation laws can all be deduced from a single Lagrangian density expression.;52 Conclusions-Specific
The formalism presented is Lorentz invariant.;31 Method-Specific
This paper follows on from a previous one which was limited to the single-particle case.;2 Problem
The present paper treats the more general case of many particles in an entangled state.;2 Problem
It is found that describing more than one particle while maintaining a relativistic description requires the specification of final boundary conditions as well as the usual initial ones, with the experimenterâs controllable choice of the final conditions thereby exerting a backwards-in-time influence.;42 Results-Reference
This retrocausality then allows an important theoretical step forward to be made, namely that it becomes possible to dispense with the usual, many-dimensional description in configuration space and instead revert to a description in spaceâtime using separate, single-particle wavefunctions.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

Measurements of the electrostatic force with separation between a fixed and an optically trapped colloidal particle are examined with experiment, simulation and analytical calculation.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
Non-Gaussian Brownian motion is observed in the position of the optically trapped particle when particles are close and traps weak.;41 Results-Specific
As a consequence of this motion, a simple least squares parameterization of direct force measurements, in which force is inferred from the displacement of an optically trapped particle as separation is gradually decreased, contains forces generated by the rectification of thermal fluctuations in addition to those originating directly from the electrostatic interaction between the particles.;41 Results-Specific
Thus, when particles are close and traps weak, simply fitting the measured direct force measurement to DLVO theory extracts parameters with modified meanings when compared to the original formulation.;52 Conclusions-Specific
In such cases, however, physically meaningful DLVO parameters can be recovered by comparing the measured non-Gaussian statistics to those predicted by solutions to Smoluchowski's equation for diffusion in a potential.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Thin films of long and short symmetric AB diblock copolymers are examined using self-consistent field theory (SCFT).;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
We focus on hard confining walls with a preference for the A component, such that the lamellar domains orient parallel to the film with an even number Î½ of monolayers.;32 Method-Procedure
For neat melts, confinement causes the lamellar period, D, to deviate from its bulk value, Db, in order to be commensurate with the film thickness, i.e., L=Î½D/2.;41 Results-Specific
For blends, however, the melt also has the option of macrophase separating into Î½(â) large and Î½(s) small monolayers so as to provide a better fit, where L=Î½(â)D(â)/2+Î½(s)D(s)/2.;41 Results-Specific
In addition to performing full SCFT calculations of the entire film, we develop a semi-analytical calculation for the coexistence of thick and thin monolayers that helps explain the complicated interplay between miscibility and commensurability.;2 Problem

There are many fascinating processes in the universe which we observe in more detail thanks to increasingly sophisticated technology.;1 Background
One of the most interesting phenomena is the life cycle of stars, their birth, evolution and death.;1 Background
If the stars are massive enough, they end their lives in a core-collapse supernova explosion, one of the most violent events in the universe.;1 Background
As a result, the densest objects in the universe, neutron stars and/or black holes, are created.;1 Background
The physical basis of these events should be understood in line with observation.;2 Problem
Unfortunately, available data do not provide adequate constraints for many theoretical models of dense matter.;2 Problem
One of the most open areas of research is the composition of matter in the cores of neutron stars.;2 Problem
Unambiguous fingerprints for the appearance and evolution of particular components, such as strange baryons and mesons, with increasing density, have not been identified.;2 Problem
In particular, the hadron-quark phase transition remains a subject of intensive research.;2 Problem
In this contribution we briefly survey the most promising observational and theoretical directions leading to progress in understanding high density matter in neutron stars.;2 Problem
A possible way forward in modeling high-density matter is outlined, exemplified by the quark-meson-coupling model (QMC).;42 Results-Reference
This model makes connection between hadronic structure and the underlying quark make-up.;42 Results-Reference
It offers a natural explanation for the saturation of nuclear force and treats high-density matter, containing the full baryon octet, in terms of four uniquely defined parameters adjusted to properties of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We classify the weakly interacting fixed points of general gauge theories coupled to matter and explain how the competition between gauge and matter fluctuations gives rise to a rich spectrum of high- and low-energy fixed points.;2 Problem
The pivotal role played by Yukawa couplings is emphasised.;42 Results-Reference
Necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic safety of gauge theories are also derived, in conjunction with strict no go theorems.;42 Results-Reference
Implications for phase diagrams of gauge theories and physics beyond the Standard Model are indicated.;42 Results-Reference

We reconsider the fundamental commutation relations for non-commutative â2 described in polar coordinates with non-commutativity parameter Î¸.;2 Problem
Previous analysis found that the natural transition from Cartesian coordinates to the traditional polar system led to a representation of [rÌ,ÏÌ] as an everywhere diverging series.;1 Background
In this article we compute the Borel resummation of this series, showing that it can subsequently be extended throughout parameter space and hence provide an interpretation of this commutator.;2 Problem, 52 Conclusions-Specific
Our analysis provides a complete solution for arbitrary r and Î¸ that reproduces the earlier calculations at lowest order and benefits from being generally applicable to problems in a two-dimensional non-commutative space.;52 Conclusions-Specific
We compare our results to previous literature in the (pseudo-)commuting limit, finding a surprising spatial dependence for the coordinate commutator when Î¸â«r2.;42 Results-Reference
Finally, we raise some questions for future study in light of this progress.;2 Problem

This paper examines unexplored correlations in the parameter spaces probed by recent ATLAS analyses for gluinos and squarks, addressing various shortcomings in the literature.;2 Problem
Six 13 TeV ATLAS analyses based on 3.2 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity are interpreted in the 19-parameter R-parity conserving phenomenological minimal supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model (pMSSM).;32 Method-Procedure
The distinct regions covered by each search are independent of prior, and we reveal particularly striking complementarity between the 2â6 jets and Multi-b searches.;42 Results-Reference
In the leptonic searches, we identify better sensitivity to models than those used for analysis optimisation, notably a squarkâsleptonâwino scenario for the SS/3L search.;42 Results-Reference
Further, we show how collider searches for coloured states probe the structure of the pMSSM dark sector more extensively than the Monojet analysis alone, with sensitivity to parameter spaces that are challenging for direct detection experiments.;42 Results-Reference

"Previously, in Penner (Astrophys. Space Sci. 361:124, 2016a, Astrophys. Space Sci. 361:361, 2016b), a theory of gravitational anti-screening was shown to lead naturally to the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relationship.";1 Background
In addition, it was shown to agree with the observed rotational curve of the Galaxy, the observed features in the rotational curves of other spiral galaxies, with observations of the Coma cluster, and with a geometrically flat universe.;1 Background
In this paper the theory will now be applied to binary galaxies.;2 Problem
It is shown that there is a relationship between the line-of-sight velocity difference of the pair and the individual rotational velocities of the galaxies.;42 Results-Reference
The resulting probability function for Î², defined as the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity difference to the rotational velocity of the larger galaxy of the pair, is in excellent agreement with the observations taken by multiple researchers for the case of the binaries being on radial orbits.;41 Results-Specific

This article discusses the role of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) in understanding the natural environment, and in particular the dynamics of atmospheres and oceans on Earth and elsewhere.;2 Problem
GFD, as usually understood, is a branch of the geosciences that deals with fluid dynamics and that, by tradition, seeks to extract the bare essence of a phenomenon, omitting detail where possible.;1 Background
The geosciences in general deal with complex interacting systems and in some ways resemble condensed matter physics or aspects of biology, where we seek explanations of phenomena at a higher level than simply directly calculating the interactions of all the constituent parts.;1 Background
That is, we try to develop theories or make simple models of the behaviour of the system as a whole.;2 Problem
However, these days in many geophysical systems of interest, we can also obtain information for how the system behaves by almost direct numerical simulation from the governing equations.;2 Problem
The numerical model itself then explicitly predicts the emergent phenomenaâthe Gulf Stream, for exampleâsomething that is still usually impossible in biology or condensed matter physics.;2 Problem
Such simulations, as manifested, for example, in complicated general circulation models, have in some ways been extremely successful and one may reasonably now ask whether understanding a complex geophysical system is necessary for predicting it.;2 Problem
In what follows we discuss such issues and the roles that GFD has played in the past and will play in the future.;2 Problem

This paper demonstrates an equivalence between rotating magnetized shear flows and a stressed elastic beam.;2 Problem
This results from finding the same form of dynamical equations after an asymptotic reduction of the axis-symmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) under the assumption of almost-critical driving.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
The analysis considers the MRI dynamics in a non-dissipative near-equilibrium regime.;32 Method-Procedure
Both the magnetic and elastic systems reduce to a simple one-dimensional wave equation with a non-local nonlinear feedback.;42 Results-Reference
Under transformation, the equation comprises a large number of mean-field interacting Duffing oscillators.;41 Results-Specific
This system was the first proven example of a strange attractor in a partial differential equation.;41 Results-Specific
Finding the same reduced equation in two natural applications suggests the model might result from other applications and could fall into a universal class based on symmetry.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

The change in entropy, ÎS, associated with the quasi-static absorption of a particle of energy Îµ by a Schwarzschild black hole (ScBH) is approximately (Îµ/T)âs, where T is the Hawking temperature of the black hole and s is the entropy of the particle.;1 Background
Motivated by the statistical interpretation of entropy, it is proposed here that the absorption should be suppressed, but not forbidden, when ÎS<0, which requires the absorption cross section to be sensitive to ÎS.;52 Conclusions-Specific
A purely thermodynamic formulation of the probability for the absorption is obtained from the standard relationship between microstates and entropy.;42 Results-Reference
If ÎSâ«1 and sâªÎµ/T, then the probability for the particle not to be absorbed is approximately exp[âÎµ/T], which is identical to the probability for quantum mechanical reflection by the horizon of an ScBH.;41 Results-Specific
The manifestation of quantum behaviours in the new probability function may intimate a fundamental physical unity between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

Responses in surface winds to solar eclipses have an almost mystical status but are difficult to detect in observations because of their transient nature.;2 Problem
High spatial resolution (approx. 1.5 km grid) meteorological models now provide a new  technique for their investigation.;2 Problem
Measurements from the southern UK meteorological network during the 11 August 1999 total solar eclipse are compared with a high-resolution model ignorant of the lunar shadow's influence.;32 Method-Procedure
Differences between the model output and measurements at the eclipse time show transient eclipse zone temperature decreases of up to 3Â°C, which also depressed the day's maximum temperature compared with the model prediction.;41 Results-Specific
Coherent responses in temperature, and wind speed and direction measurements are detected in the inland cloud-free region (from 51Â° to 52Â°âN and â2Â° to 0Â°âE).;41 Results-Specific
"A mean regional wind speed decrease of 0.7âmâsâ1 during the maximum eclipse hour is apparent with a mean anticlockwise wind direction change of 17Â°, no such changes occurred in the model output.";41 Results-Specific
Such regional circulation changes are consistent with Clayton's 1901 cold-cored eclipse cyclone hypothesis, which may be related to the anecdotal âeclipse windâ.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

An ensemble of pure numbers of the order of 10122 is produced naturally from the fundamental parameters of modern cosmology.;1 Background
This new large-number coincidence problem is resolved by demonstrating implicit physical connections that follow from the standard cosmological model.;2 Problem
However, the occurrence of the new large-number coincidence combined with the known coincidence among pure numbers of the order of 1040 poses a distinct problem that is resolved with a scaling law for the cosmological constant that was originally proposed by Zel'dovich.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific

A central topic in the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is the definition of thermodynamic work in the quantum regime.;1 Background
One widely used solution is to define work for a closed system undergoing non-equilibrium dynamics according to the two-point energy measurement scheme.;1 Background
However, due to the invasive nature of measurement the two-point quantum work probability distribution cannot describe the statistics of energy change from the perspective of the system alone.;2 Problem
We here introduce the quantum histories framework as a method to characterise the thermodynamic properties of the unmeasured, closed dynamics.;2 Problem
Constructing continuous power operator trajectories allows us to derive an alternative quantum work distribution for closed quantum dynamics that fulfils energy conservation and is time-reversal symmetric.;42 Results-Reference
This opens the possibility to compare the measured work with the unmeasured work, contrasting with the classical situation where measurement does not affect the work statistics.;52 Conclusions-Specific
We find that the work distribution of the unmeasured dynamics leads to deviations from the classical Jarzynski equality and can have negative values highlighting distinctly non-classical features of quantum work.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Processes that involve moving fronts of populations are prevalent in ecology and cell biology.;1 Background
A common approach to describe these processes is a lattice-based random walk model, which can include mechanisms such as crowding, birth, death, movement and agentâagent adhesion.;1 Background
However, these models are generally analytically intractable and it is computationally expensive to perform sufficiently many realisations of the model to obtain an estimate of average behaviour that is not dominated by random fluctuations.;2 Problem
To avoid these issues, both mean-field (MF) and corrected mean-field (CMF) continuum descriptions of random walk models have been proposed.;1 Background
However, both continuum descriptions are inaccurate outside of limited parameter regimes, and CMF descriptions cannot be employed to describe moving fronts.;2 Problem
Here we present an alternative description in terms of the dynamics of groups of contiguous occupied lattice sites and contiguous vacant lattice sites.;2 Problem
Our description provides an accurate prediction of the average random walk behaviour in all parameter regimes.;42 Results-Reference
Critically, our description accurately predicts the persistence or extinction of the population in situations where previous continuum descriptions predict the opposite outcome.;42 Results-Reference
Furthermore, unlike traditional MF models, our approach provides information about the spatial clustering within the population and, subsequently, the moving front.;42 Results-Reference

The presence of contextuality in quantum theory was first highlighted by Bell, Kochen and Specker, who discovered that for quantum systems of three or more dimensions, measurements could not be viewed as deterministically revealing pre-existing properties of the system.;1 Background
More precisely, no model can assign deterministic outcomes to the projectors of a quantum measurement in a way that depends only on the projector and not the context (the full set of projectors) in which it appeared, despite the fact that the Born rule probabilities associated with projectors are independent of the context.;1 Background
A more general, operational definition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens, which we will term 'probabilistic contextuality', drops the assumption of determinism and allows for operations other than measurements to be considered contextual.;1 Background
Even two-dimensional quantum mechanics can be shown to be contextual under this generalised notion.;1 Background
Probabilistic noncontextuality represents the postulate that elements of an operational theory that cannot be distinguished from each other based on the statistics of arbitrarily many repeated experiments (they give rise to the same operational probabilities) are ontologically identical.;1 Background
In this paper, we introduce a framework that enables us to distinguish between different noncontextuality assumptions in terms of the relationships between the ontological representations of objects in the theory given a certain relation between their operational representations.;2 Problem
This framework can be used to motivate and define a 'possibilistic' analogue, encapsulating the idea that elements of an operational theory that cannot be unambiguously distinguished operationally can also not be unambiguously distinguished ontologically.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
We then prove that possibilistic noncontextuality is equivalent to an alternative notion of noncontextuality proposed by Hardy.;2 Problem
Finally, we demonstrate that these weaker noncontextuality assumptions are sufficient to prove alternative versions of known 'no-go' theorems that constrain Ï-epistemic models for quantum mechanics.;2 Problem

The BarrettâCavalcantiâLalâMaroney (BCLM) argument stands as the most effective means of demonstrating the reality of the quantum state.;1 Background
Its advantages include being derived from very few assumptions, and a robustness to experimental error.;1 Background
Finding the best way to implement the argument experimentally is an open problem, however, and involves cleverly choosing sets of states and measurements.;2 Problem
I show that techniques from convex optimisation theory can be leveraged to numerically search for these sets, which then form a recipe for experiments that allow for the strongest statements about the ontology of the wavefunction to be made.;2 Problem
The optimisation approach presented is versatile, efficient and can take account of the finite errors present in any real experiment.;52 Conclusions-Specific
I find significantly improved low-cardinality sets which are guaranteed partially optimal for a BCLM test in low Hilbert space dimension.;42 Results-Reference
I further show that mixed states can be more optimal than pure states.;53 Conclusions-Reference

I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state space) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches traditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm (QAA).;2 Problem
Such protocols will have numerous advantages over simple quantum annealing.;53 Conclusions-Reference
By using such searches the effect of problem mis-specification can be reduced, as only energy differences between the searched states will be relevant.;52 Conclusions-Specific
The QAA is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical technique which has now been superseded.;1 Background
Hence, I explore two strategies to use an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization algorithms.;2 Problem
Specifically, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can be used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering which use quantum searches as subroutines.;2 Problem
The techniques given here can be applied not only to optimization, but also to sampling.;52 Conclusions-Specific
I examine the feasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such protocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the flux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc.;32 Method-Procedure
I further provide proof-of-principle numerical experiments based on quantum Monte Carlo that demonstrate simple examples of the discussed techniques.;31 Method-Specific

We propose a method for sorting electrons by orbital angular momentum (OAM).;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
Several methods now exist to prepare electron wavefunctions in OAM states, but no technique has been developed for efficient, parallel measurement of pure and mixed electron OAM states.;2 Problem
The proposed technique draws inspiration from the recent demonstration of the sorting of OAM through modal transformation.;31 Method-Specific
We show that the same transformation can be performed on electrons with electrostatic optical elements.;42 Results-Reference
Specifically, we show that a charged needle and an array of electrodes perform the transformation and phase correction necessary to sort OAM states.;41 Results-Specific
This device may enable the analysis of the spatial mode distribution of inelastically scattered electrons.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The properties of nonlinear dynamics and chaos are shown to be fundamental to optimal communication signals subject to two practical and realistic design requirements: (i) operation in a noisy environment and (ii) simple hardware implementation.;42 Results-Reference
Starting with a simple electronic circuit, a linear filter receiver is presumed, and the matched optimal communication waveform that maximizes the receiver signal-to-noise performance is derived.;42 Results-Reference
A return map using samples from this optimal waveform is conjugate to a shift, thereby implying the waveform is chaotic. ;42 Results-Reference
The optimal communication waveform for a second simple receiver is similarly derived, and it is found to be an exact solution to a physically realizable chaotic oscillator.;42 Results-Reference
Thus, a practical consequence of chaos in these waveforms is the potential for simple and efficient signal generation using chaotic oscillators.;52 Conclusions-Specific
A conjecture is made that the optimal communication waveform for any stable infinite impulse response filter is similarly chaotic.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Solitons in the SkyrmeâFaddeev model on Embedded Image are shown to undergo buckling transitions as the circumference of the S1 is varied.;42 Results-Reference

Photonic crystal waveguides are known to support C-pointsâpoint-like polarization singularities with local chirality.;1 Background
Such points can couple with dipole-like emitters to produce highly directional emission, from which spin-photon entanglers can be built.;1 Background
Much is made of the promise of using slow-light modes to enhance this lightâmatter coupling.;1 Background
Here we explore the transition from travelling to standing waves for two different photonic crystal waveguide designs.;2 Problem
We find that time-reversal symmetry and the reciprocal nature of light places constraints on using C-points in the slow-light regime.;42 Results-Reference
We observe two distinctly different mechanisms through which this condition is satisfied in the two waveguides.;42 Results-Reference
In the waveguide designs, we consider a modest group velocity of vgâc/10 is found to be the optimum for slow-light coupling to the C-points.;41 Results-Specific

The theory of the one-dimensional (1D) hydrogen atom was initiated by a 1952 paper but, after more than 60 years, it remains a topic of debate and controversy.;2 Problem

A 1959 solution of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation by the use of a cut-off at x=a to remove the singularity at the origin in the 1/|x| form of the potential is clarified and a mistaken approximation is identified.;42 Results-Reference
The singular atom is not found in the real world but the theory with cut-off has been applied successfully to a range of four practical three-dimensional systems confined towards one dimension, particularly their observed large increases in ground state binding energy.;1 Background
The true 1D atom is in principle restored when the short distance a tends to zero but it is sometimes claimed that the solutions obtained by the limiting procedure differ from those obtained by solution of the basic SchrÃ¶dinger equation without any cut-off in the potential.;1 Background
The treatment of the singularity by a limiting procedure for applications to practical systems is endorsed.;42 Results-Reference

It is 100 years since Minkowski and Abraham first gave rival expressions for the momentum of light in a material medium. ;1 Background
At the single-photon level, these correspond, respectively, either to multiplying or dividing the free-space value (Embedded Image) by the refractive index (n).;1 Background
The debate that this work started has continued till the present day, punctuated by the occasional publication of âdecisiveâ experimental demonstrations supporting one or other of these values.;2 Problem
We review the compelling arguments made in support of the Minkowski and Abraham forms and are led to the conclusion that both momenta are correct.;2 Problem
We explain why two distinct momenta are needed to describe light in a medium and why each appears as the natural, and experimentally observed, momentum in appropriate situations.;2 Problem

In-plane (lateral) and out-of-plane (transverse) shifts in the direction of arbitrarily polarized electromagnetic waves in a denser medium, reflected totally or partially at an interface with a rarer medium, are calculated exactly, in terms of the deviation of the Poynting vector from radial.;42 Results-Reference
The shifts are analogous to the GoosâHÃ¤nchen and FedorovâImbert shifts for beams.;42 Results-Reference
There is a transverse shift even for unreflected dipole radiation if the polarization is not linear.;41 Results-Specific
With reflection, there is a transverse shift for linear polarization, provided this is not pure transverse electric or transverse magnetic.;41 Results-Specific
The contributions from the geometrical ray, the lateral ray that interferes strongly with it, and the large peak at the Brewster angle (for transverse magnetic polarization), are calculated asymptotically far from the geometrical image.;32 Method-Procedure
At the critical angle, the lowest order asymptotics is inadequate and a more sophisticated treatment is devised, reproducing the exact shifts accurately.;42 Results-Reference

After discussing several issues in a future redefinition of the kilogram, this paper considers the lessons that one might have learned from the analogous redefinitions of the metre and the second.;2 Problem
The progress of length metrology was  slow and steady, from seven digits reproducibility with the 1889 X-shaped metre prototype, to nine digits with Kr lamps, to 11 digits with the 1983 redefinition of the metre using the speed of light.;1 Background
With laser cooling, the Cs clock improved to 15, now 16, digits (and so also astronomical distance measurements could improve).;1 Background
Laser-cooled ions, and now atoms captured and cooled in an optical lattice, enable accuracy capability of three different optical frequency references to exceed 17 digits, i.e. better than time itself.;1 Background
The optical comb and related techniques vastly simplify frequency comparisons.;1 Background
Such progress stimulates a new satellite experiment, the STAR Mission (SpaceâTime Asymmetry Research).;1 Background
The goal is to test at the 1Eâ18 level frequency shifts owing to spatial anisotropy, position, gravitational potential and boost.;2 Problem

In the event of a single, low-yield nuclear detonation in a major urban area, rapidly providing adequate shelter to affected populations could save 10â000â100â000 individuals from a fatal exposure to fallout radiation.;1 Background
However, poorly sheltered individuals may remain at risk.;2 Problem
Current guidance and prior studies are not consistent as to the timing and conditions under which poorly sheltered individuals should leave their shelters to evacuate or obtain better shelter.;2 Problem
This study proposes methods to determine the optimal shelter time based on information potentially available following a nuclear detonation.;2 Problem
For the case in which individuals move to an adequate shelter that can be reached within 15âmin, individuals should stay in a poor-quality shelter for at most 30âmin after the detonation.;52 Conclusions-Specific
If adequate shelter is available nearby (within 5âmin), then poorly sheltered individuals should immediately proceed to the better shelter.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Since the 1935 work of LandauâLifshitz and of Kittel in 1946 all ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferroelastic domains have been thought to be straight-sided with domain widths proportional to the square root of the sample thickness.;1 Background
We show in the present work that this is not true.;2 Problem
We also discover period doubling domains predicted by Metaxas et al (2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 217208) and modeled by Wang and Zhao (2015 Sci. Rep. 5 8887).;42 Results-Reference
We examine non-equilibrium ferroic domain structures in perovskite oxides with respect to folding, wrinkling, and relaxation and suggest that structures are kinetically limited and in the viscous flow regime predicted by Metaxas et al in 2008 but never observed experimentally.;2 Problem
Comparisons are made with liquid crystals and hydrodynamic instabilities, including chevrons, and fractional power-law relaxation.;32 Method-Procedure
As Shin et al (2016 Soft Matter 12 3502) recently emphasized: 'An understanding of how these folds initiate, propagate, and interact with each other is still lacking'.;1 Background
Inside each ferroelastic domain are ferroelectric 90Â° nano-domains with 10ânm widths and periodicity in agreement with the 10ânm theoretical minima predicted by Feigl et al (2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4677).;1 Background
Evidence is presented for domain-width period doubling, which is common in polymer films but unknown in ferroic domains.;42 Results-Reference
A discussion of the folding-to-period doubling phase transition model of Wang and Zhao is included.;42 Results-Reference

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a powerful tool for understanding the chemical structure of materials down to the atomic level, but challenges remain in accurately and quantitatively modelling the response.;1 Background, 2 Problem
We compare comprehensive theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations of 1s core-level EEL K-edge spectra of pure, B-doped and N-doped graphene with and without a core-hole to previously published atomic-resolution experimental electron microscopy data.;2 Problem, 32 Method-Procedure
The ground state approximation is found in this specific system to perform consistently better than the frozen core-hole approximation.;42 Results-Reference
The impact of including or excluding a core-hole on the resultant theoretical band structures, densities of states, electron densities and EEL spectra were all thoroughly examined and compared.;42 Results-Reference
It is concluded that the frozen core-hole approximation exaggerates the effects of the core-hole in graphene and should be discarded in favour of the ground state approximation.;52 Conclusions-Specific
These results are interpreted as an indicator of the overriding need for theorists to embrace many-body effects in the pursuit of accuracy in theoretical spectroscopy instead of a system-tailored approach whose approximations are selected empirically.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The defect in diamond formed by a vacancy surrounded by three nearest-neighbor nitrogen atoms and one carbon atom, ${{\text{N}}_{3}}\text{V}$, is found in the vast majority of natural diamonds.;1 Background
Despite ${{\text{N}}_{3}}{{\text{V}}^{0}}$ being the earliest electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum observed in diamond, to date no satisfactory simulation of the spectrum for an arbitrary magnetic field direction has been produced due to its complexity.;2 Problem
In this work, ${{\text{N}}_{3}}{{\text{V}}^{0}}$ is identified in ${{}^{15}}\text{N}$ -doped synthetic diamond following irradiation and annealing.;2 Problem
The ${{}^{15}}{{\text{N}}_{3}}{{\text{V}}^{0}}$ spin Hamiltonian parameters are directly determined and used to refine the parameters for ${{}^{14}}{{\text{N}}_{3}}{{\text{V}}^{0}}$, enabling the latter to be accurately simulated and fitted for an arbitrary magnetic field direction.;32 Method-Procedure
Study of ${{}^{15}}{{\text{N}}_{3}}{{\text{V}}^{0}}$ under excitation with green light indicates charge transfer between ${{\text{N}}_{3}}\text{V}$ and ${{\text{N}}_{\text{s}}}$.;42 Results-Reference
It is argued that this charge transfer is facilitated by direct ionization of ${{\text{N}}_{3}}{{\text{V}}^{-}}$, an as-yet unobserved charge state of ${{\text{N}}_{3}}\text{V}$.;42 Results-Reference

The method of neutron diffraction with isomorphic substitution was used to measure the structure of the rare-earth chalcogenide glasses ${{\left({{R}_{2}}{{X}_{3}}\right)}_{0.07}}$ (Ga2 X 3)0.33(GeX 2)0.60 with $R=\text{La}$ or Ce and $X=\text{S}$ or Se.;31 Method-Specific
X-ray diffraction was also used to measure the structure of the sulphide glass.;31 Method-Specific
The results are consistent with networks that are built from GeX 4 and GaX 4 tetrahedra, and give RâS and RâSe coordination numbers of 8.0(2) and 8.5(4), respectively.;41 Results-Specific
The minimum nearest-neighbour RâR distance associated with rare-earth clustering is discussed.;2 Problem

We discuss the static configuration of a smectic A liquid crystal subject to an edge dislocation under the assumption that the director and layer normal fields (n and a, respectively) defining the smectic arrangement are not, in general, equivalent.;2 Problem
After constructing the free energy for the smectic, we obtain exact solutions to the equilibrium equations which result from its minimisation at quadratic order in the variables which describe the distortion, and hence a complete description of the smectic configuration across the domain of the sample.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
We also examine the effect of relaxing the constraint $n \equiv a$ for different values of the constants which characterise the response of the material to distortions, and compare these results with the 'classical' case considered by previous authors, in which equivalence of n and a is enforced.;2 Problem, 42 Results-Reference

We demonstrate a method for probing interaction effects in a thermal beam of strontium atoms using simultaneous measurements of Rydberg EIT and spontaneously created ions or electrons.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
We present a Doppler-averaged optical Bloch equation model that reproduces the optical signals and allows us to connect the optical coherences and the populations.;31 Method-Specific
We use this to determine that the spontaneous ionization process in our system occurs due to collisions between Rydberg and ground state atoms in the EIT regime.;32 Method-Procedure
We measure the cross section of this process to be $0.6\pm 0.2\,\,{\sigma }_{\mathrm{geo}}$, where ${\sigma }_{\mathrm{geo}}$ is the geometrical cross section of the Rydberg atom.;41 Results-Specific
This result adds complementary insight to a range of recent studies of interacting thermal Rydberg ensembles.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We present a protocol for rotation measurement via matter-wave Sagnac interferometry using trapped ions.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
The ion trap based interferometer encloses a large area in a compact apparatus through repeated round-trips in a Sagnac geometry.;32 Method-Procedure
We show how a uniform magnetic field can be used to close the interferometer over a large dynamic range in rotation speed and measurement bandwidth without contrast loss.;2 Problem
Since this technique does not require the ions to be confined in the LambâDicke regime, Doppler laser cooling should be sufficient to reach a sensitivity of ${ \mathcal S }=1.4\times {10}^{-6}\,{\rm{rad}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{{\rm{H}}{\rm{z}}}^{-1/2}$.;41 Results-Specific

The Coulomb approximation (CA) has long been regarded as a useful tool for rapid estimates of line strengths, absorption oscillator strengths, and spontaneous transition probabilities of the lighter multi-electron atoms and ions, in situations where large quantities of atomic data are required for the analysis of spectroscopic measurements from a variety of plasma sources, in particular interesting stellar objects (e. g. white dwarf stars) and magnetically confined fusion plasmas.;1 Background
This applies especially in cases where the plasma is spatially inhomogeneous, and produces several ionisation stages of the same impurity element, emitting copious radiation in boundâbound transitions from cascade processes following charge-exchange recombination.;1 Background
While more advanced theoretical methods are routinely used by the specialist, the CA provides a very convenient method of checking atomic data chosen by the experimentalist from extensive compilations through the internet, or by the use of machine codes provided by others.;1 Background
The origins, advantages and shortcomings of the method are described and discussed, as well as convenient modifications thereof, which may readily be implemented for these purposes.;2 Problem
Particular attention is paid to the choice of electron coupling of states in which the optical electron has a large orbital angular momentum $({\ell }\geqslant 3).$ ;42 Results-Reference
The text is illustrated by numerous examples of application to spectra of practical interest from astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.;42 Results-Reference

Radiative charge exchange collisions between a carbon atom ${\rm{C}}({}^{3}P)$ and a helium ion ${\mathrm{He}}^{+}({}^{2}S)$, both in their ground state, are investigated theoretically.;2 Problem
Detailed quantum chemistry calculations are carried out to obtain potential energy curves and transition dipole matrix elements for doublet and quartet molecular states of the HeC+ cation.;42 Results-Reference
Radiative charge transfer cross sections and rate coefficients are calculated and are found at thermal and lower energies to be large compared to those for direct charge transfer.;42 Results-Reference
The present results might be applicable to modelling the complex interplay of $[{\rm{C}}\,{\rm{II}}$ (or ${{\rm{C}}}^{+}$), ${\rm{C}}$, and $\mathrm{CO}$ at the boundaries of interstellar photon dominated regions and in x-ray dominated regions, where the abundance of ${\mathrm{He}}^{+}$ affects the abundance of $\mathrm{CO}$.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We describe methods using frequency combs and optical resonators for recording two-dimensional (2D) ultrafast spectroscopy signals with high sensitivity.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
By coupling multiple frequency combs to higher-order modes of one or more optical cavities, background-free, cavity-enhanced 2D spectroscopy signals are naturally generated via phase cycling.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference
As in cavity-enhanced ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, the signal to noise is enhanced by a factor proportional to the cavity finesse squared, so even using cavities of modest finesse, a very high sensitivity is expected, enabling ultrafast 2D spectroscopy experiments in dilute molecular beams.;41 Results-Specific, 52 Conclusions-Specific

As part of the quest to uncover universal features of quantum dynamics, we study catastrophes that form in simple many-particle wave functions following a quench, focusing on two-mode systems that include the two-site BoseâHubbard model, and under some circumstances optomechanical systems and the Dicke model.;2 Problem
When the wave function is plotted in Fock space certain characteristic shapes, that we identify as cusp catastrophes, appear under generic conditions.;42 Results-Reference
In the vicinity of a cusp the wave function takes on a universal structure described by the Pearcey function and obeys scaling relations which depend on the total number of particles N.;42 Results-Reference
In the thermodynamic limit ($N\to \infty $) the cusp becomes singular, but at finite N it is decorated by an interference pattern.;42 Results-Reference
This pattern contains an intricate network of vortexâantivortex pairs, initiating a theory of topological structures in Fock space.;42 Results-Reference
In the case where the quench is a Î´-kick the problem can be solved analytically and we obtain scaling exponents for the size and position of the cusp, as well as those for the amplitude and characteristic length scales of its interference pattern.;42 Results-Reference
Finally, we use these scalings to describe the wave function in the critical regime of a ${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$ symmetry-breaking dynamical phase transition.;42 Results-Reference

We analyze the temporal response of the fluorescence light that is emitted from a dense gas of cold atoms driven by a laser.;2 Problem
When the average interatomic distance is comparable to the wavelength of the photons scattered by the atoms, the system exhibits strong dipolar interactions and collective dissipation.;42 Results-Reference
We solve the exact dynamics of small systems with different geometries and show how these collective features are manifest in the scattered light properties such as the photon emission rate, the power spectrum and the second-order correlation function.;2 Problem
By calculating these quantities beyond the weak (linear) driving limit, we make progress in understanding the signatures of collective behavior in these many-body systems.;52 Conclusions-Specific
Furthermore, we shed light on the role of disorder and averaging on the resonance fluorescence, of direct relevance for recent experimental efforts that aim at the exploration of many-body effects in dipoleâdipole interacting gases of atoms.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The differential event rate in weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) direct detection experiments depends on the local dark matter density and velocity distribution.;1 Background
Accurate modelling of the local dark matter distribution is therefore required to obtain reliable constraints on the WIMP particle physics properties.;2 Problem
Data analyses typically use a simple standard halo model which might not be a good approximation to the real Milky Way (MW) halo.;2 Problem
We review observational determinations of the local dark matter density, circular speed and escape speed and also studies of the local dark matter distribution in simulated MW-like galaxies.;2 Problem
We discuss the effects of the uncertainties in these quantities on the energy spectrum and its time and direction dependence.;2 Problem
Finally, we conclude with an overview of various methods for handling these astrophysical uncertainties.;2 Problem

A two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in yields and spectra derived from the charge-multiplicity dependence of 200 GeV pâp collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider is extended to describe pâp spectrum data from the large hadron collider (LHC) up to 13 TeV.;2 Problem
The LHC data include spectrum ratios that provide only partial information on the TCM.;2 Problem
The LHC ratio method is applied to well-understood 200 GeV spectrum data to derive an algebraic link between spectrum ratios and the full TCM.;31 Method-Specific
Some aspects of the form of the hard component on transverse momentum are found to be n ch dependent.;42 Results-Reference
LHC spectrum ratios are then analyzed to obtain n ch and collision-energy (over three orders of magnitude) dependence of isolated soft and hard TCM spectrum components.;32 Method-Procedure
The energy dependence of the spectrum soft component is a new result suggesting a relation to Gribov diffusion.;42 Results-Reference
The spectrum hard component varies simply and smoothly with n ch suggesting bias of the underlying jet spectrum and linearly with QCD parameter $\mathrm{log}(s/{s}_{0})$, its properties consistent with minimum-bias reconstructed-jet spectrum measurements.;42 Results-Reference

Î³-process nucleosynthesis that occurs during an explosion of a type II supernova can be modeled via post-processing network calculations that require a model of the stellar environment and the rates for all the nuclear reactions involved in the process.;1 Background
The nuclear input for these calculations relies on reaction rates obtained from statistical models.;2 Problem
In this work, the sensitivity of the Î³-process nucleosynthesis to the Î± optical model potential used in statistical model was investigated.;2 Problem
Network calculations were performed for two sets of reaction rates, the current version of Reaclib and with rates for Î±-induced reactions and their inverse replaced with those calculated using Talys.;32 Method-Procedure, 31 Method-Specific
Significant changes in the final abundance pattern were observed and a list of reactions that need to be measured in order to discriminate between the two nucleosynthesis scenarios is provided.;42 Results-Reference

In this article, recent studies so far conducted with post accelerated beams at the ISOLDE facility in the area of nuclear astrophysics are reviewed.;2 Problem
Two experiments in particular are highlighted, that each feature novelty and innovation.;42 Results-Reference
Three future experiments are also briefly presented.;42 Results-Reference
Collectively, these works advance our understanding of big bang nucleosynthesis, quiescent and explosive burning in novae and x-ray bursts, and core-collapse supernovae, both in terms of the underlying explosion mechanism and gamma-ray satellite observable radioisotopes.;52 Conclusions-Specific

The bulk of the rare earth elements are believed to be synthesized in the rapid neutron capture process or r process of nucleosynthesis.;1 Background
The solar r-process residuals show a small peak in the rare earths around $A\sim 160$, which is proposed to be formed dynamically during the end phase of the r process by a pileup of material.;1 Background
This abundance feature is of particular importance as it is sensitive to both the nuclear physics inputs and the astrophysical conditions of the main r process.;2 Problem
We explore the formation of the rare earth peak from the perspective of an inverse problem, using Monte Carlo studies of nuclear masses to investigate the unknown nuclear properties required to best match rare earth abundance sector of the solar isotopic residuals.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
When nuclear masses are changed, we recalculate the relevant Î²-decay properties and neutron capture rates in the rare earth region.;32 Method-Procedure
The feedback provided by this observational constraint allows for the reverse engineering of nuclear properties far from stability where no experimental information exists.;52 Conclusions-Specific
We investigate a range of astrophysical conditions with this method and show how these lead to different predictions in the nuclear properties influential to the formation of the rare earth peak.;2 Problem
We conclude that targeted experimental campaigns in this region will help to resolve the type of conditions responsible for the production of the rare earth nuclei, and will provide new insights into the longstanding problem of the astrophysical site(s) of the r process.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Thermal quantum time-correlation functions are of fundamental importance in quantum dynamics, allowing experimentally measurable properties such as reaction rates, diffusion constants and vibrational spectra to be computed from first principles.;1 Background
Since the exact quantum solution scales exponentially with system size, there has been considerable effort in formulating reliable linear-scaling methods involving exact quantum statistics and approximate quantum dynamics modelled with classical-like trajectories.;1 Background
Here, we review recent progress in the field with the development of methods including centroid molecular dynamics, ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and thermostatted RPMD (TRPMD).;2 Problem
We show how these methods have recently been obtained from âMatsubara dynamicsâ, a form of semiclassical dynamics which conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution.;2 Problem
We also apply the Matsubara formalism to reaction rate theory, rederiving t â 0+ quantum transition-state theory (QTST) and showing that Matsubara-TST, like RPMD-TST, is equivalent to QTST.;32 Method-Procedure, 42 Results-Reference

Materials that change shape are attractive candidates to replace traditional actuators for applications with power or size restrictions.;1 Background
In this work, we design a polymeric bilayer that changes shape in response to both heat and water by the incorporation of a water-responsive hydrophilic polymer with a heat-responsive liquid crystal elastomer.;2 Problem
The distinct shape changes based on stimulus are controlled by the molecular order, and consequently the anisotropic modulus, of a liquid crystal elastomer.;32 Method-Procedure
In response to water, the hydrophilic polymer layer expands, bending the bilayer along the path dictated by the anisotropic modulus of the liquid crystal elastomer layer, which is approximately 5 times higher along the molecular orientation than in perpendicular directions.;41 Results-Specific
We demonstrate that by varying the direction of this stiffer axis in LCE films, helical pitch of the swollen bilayer can be controlled from 0.1 to 20 mm.;41 Results-Specific
By spatially patterning the stiffer axis with a resolution of 900 Î¼m2, we demonstrate bilayers that fold and bend based on the pattern within the LCE.;42 Results-Reference
In response to heat, the liquid crystal elastomer contracts along the direction of molecular order, and when this actuation is constrained by the hydrophilic polymer, this contraction results in a 3D shape that is distinct from the shape seen in water.;42 Results-Reference
Furthermore, by using the vitrification of the dry hydrophilic polymer this 3D shape can be retained in the bilayer after cooling.;42 Results-Reference
By utilizing sequential exposure to heat and water, we can drive the initially flat bilayer to reversibly shift between 3D shapes.;51 Conclusions-Explanation

A simple, versatile approach for the roughening of polymer microparticles surfaces via a deformation technique in the presence of an inorganic matrix is presented here.;2 Problem, 31 Method-Specific
The process consists of straightforward steps: (1) preparation of a bicomposite colloidal sol, that is polymer particles and inorganic particles, dispersed in a liquid, (2) drying of the mixture onto a suitable hard substrate, (3) heating the dried film above the glass transition temperature of the polymer, and (4) re-dispersion and chemical etching of the inorganic medium.;32 Method-Procedure
The primary driver is capillary imbibition of the polymer melt into the inorganic colloidal template.;32 Method-Procedure
In addition, 2D particle tracking experiments of dispersed rough particles in water were performed to probe the diffusional behaviour of the roughened objects in comparison with their smooth precursors.;32 Method-Procedure
We show that, despite large scale roughness (up to 10% asperity size with respect to particle diameter), Stokes law is obeyed and the particle motion can be modelled simply with the StokesâEinsteinâSutherland relation.;42 Results-Reference, 52 Conclusions-Specific

Thin-film bijels have many potential energy and environmental applications.;1 Background
In this work, the metastable bijel morphology space in thin-film confinement is explored with a CahnâHilliard/Brownian-Dynamics computational model.;2 Problem
The key parameters varied are the bijel liquid phase blend ratio and the bijel film thickness.;32 Method-Procedure
Simulations reveal a broad spectrum of structurally unique morphologies that have yet to be observed in experiments and which could have interesting applications in membrane science and other domains.;42 Results-Reference
Extensive analyses of surface-to-volume ratios, interfacial particle attachment statistics, and topological interfacial curvatures within the bijels are presented for a complete characterization of the morphological structure.;42 Results-Reference

Despite active research, many fundamental aspects of block copolymer ordering remain unresolved.;2 Problem
We studied the thickness-dependence of block copolymer grain coarsening kinetics, and find that thinner films order more rapidly than thicker films.;2 Problem, 41 Results-Specific
Bilayer films, or monolayers with partial layers of islands, order more slowly than monolayers because of the greater amount of material that must rearrange in a coordinated fashion.;51 Conclusions-Explanation
Sub-monolayer films order much more rapidly than monolayers, exhibiting considerably smaller activation energies, as well as larger exponents for the time-growth power-law.;42 Results-Reference
Using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly study the motion of defects in these film regimes.;31 Method-Specific
We attribute the enhanced grain growth in sub-monolayers to the film boundaries, where defects can be spontaneously eliminated.;42 Results-Reference
The boundaries thus act as efficient sinks for morphological defects, pointing towards methods for engineering rapid ordering of self-assembling thin films.;52 Conclusions-Specific

Device efficiency in key organic electronic devices such as organic photovoltaics, field transistors, and light emitting diodes has long been known to be closely tied to the conformation of the conjugated polymer chains which make up the active layers.;1 Background
Our previous results show that light exposure can have a profound effect on the structure and assembly of these optoelectronic materials in solution.;2 Problem
In order to advance our understanding of the role which solvent quality plays in this phenomenon, we have further studied the modulation of these illumination dependent structural changes on the key benchmark conjugated polymers P3HT and MEH-PPV as a function of solvent quality over a wide range of polymer solubilities.;2 Problem
Analysis of this data indicates that use of poorer conjugated polymer solvents ultimately results in larger absolute alterations to polymer conformation, denoting the crucial role which solution thermodynamics plays in this generic effect.;42 Results-Reference, 52 Conclusions-Specific
This discovery opens the door to controlling final device morphology through careful manipulation of solvent composition during solution based device casting techniques, moving our efforts closer to the development of a powerful, non-destructive, and tunable method for light-driven control of polymer conformation in novel light-responsive organic materials.;52 Conclusions-Specific

We study the three-dimensional, incompressible, non-hydrostatic Boussinesq fluid equations, which are applicable to the dynamics of the oceans and atmosphere.;2 Problem
These equations describe the interplay between velocity and buoyancy in a rotating frame.;1 Background
A hierarchy of dynamical variables is introduced whose members ${{ \Omega }_{m}}(t)$ ($1\leqslant m<\infty $) are made up from the respective sum of the L 2m -norms of vorticity and the density gradient.;32 Method-Procedure
Each ${{ \Omega }_{m}}(t)$ has a lower bound in terms of the inverse Rossby number, Ro â1, that turns out to be crucial to the argument.;32 Method-Procedure
For convenience, the ${{ \Omega }_{m}}$ are also scaled into a new set of variables D m (t).;32 Method-Procedure
By assuming the existence and uniqueness of solutions, conditional upper bounds are found on the D m (t) in terms of Ro â1 and the Reynolds number Re.;42 Results-Reference
These upper bounds vary across bands in the $\left\{{{D}_{1}},\,{{D}_{m}}\right\}$ phase plane.;41 Results-Specific
The boundaries of these bands depend subtly upon Ro â1, Re, and the inverse Froude number Fr â1.;41 Results-Specific
For example, solutions in the lower band conditionally live in an absorbing ball in which the maximum value of ${{ \Omega }_{1}}$ deviates from Re 3/4 as a function of $R{{o}^{-1}},\,Re$ and Fr â1.;41 Results-Specific

If a nonlinear function F(S) depends on a function S(x) that is represented by a factorially divergent asymptotic power series in a small parameter x, each late coefficient of the power series for F(S(x)) can be represented explicitly as an asymptotic series whose terms involve balanced combinations of the late and early coefficients of the series for S(x).;1 Background
The formula for the late terms was first described by R B Dingle but not published by him.;1 Background
Numerics for a variety of functions F(S) demonstrate this 'self-resurgence' and the accuracy of the representation.;42 Results-Reference

Real-world networks in technology, engineering and biology often exhibit dynamics that cannot be adequately reproduced using network models given by smooth dynamical systems and a fixed network topology.;2 Problem
Asynchronous networks give a theoretical and conceptual framework for the study of network dynamics where nodes can evolve independently of one another, be constrained, stop, and later restart, and where the interaction between different components of the network may depend on time, state, and stochastic effects.;1 Background
This framework is sufficiently general to encompass a wide range of applications ranging from engineering to neuroscience.;2 Problem
Typically, dynamics is piecewise smooth and there are relationships with Filippov systems.;1 Background
In this paper, we give examples of asynchronous networks, and describe the basic formalism and structure.;2 Problem

In this paper, we consider magnetic flows on 2-step nilmanifolds $M= \Gamma \backslash G$, where the Riemannian metric g and the magnetic field Ï are left-invariant.;2 Problem
Our first result is that when Ï represents a rational cohomology class and its restriction to $\mathfrak{g}={{T}_{e}}G$ vanishes on the derived algebra, then the associated magnetic flow has zero topological entropy.;41 Results-Specific
In particular, this is the case when Ï represents a rational cohomology class and is exact.;41 Results-Specific
Our second result is the construction of a magnetic field on a 2-step nilmanifold that has positive topological entropy for arbitrarily high energy levels.;41 Results-Specific

The mode-locking regions of a dynamical system are subsets of parameter space within which there exists an attracting periodic solution.;1 Background
For piecewise-linear continuous maps, these regions have a distinctive chain structure with points of zero width called shrinking points.;1 Background
In this paper a local analysis about an arbitrary shrinking point is performed.;2 Problem
This is achieved by studying the symbolic itineraries of periodic solutions in nearby mode-locking regions and performing an asymptotic analysis on one-dimensional centre manifolds in order to build a comprehensive theoretical framework for the local dynamics.;32 Method-Procedure
The main results are universal quantitative descriptions for the shape of nearby mode-locking regions, the location of nearby shrinking points, and the key properties of these shrinking points.;42 Results-Reference
The results are applied to the three-dimensional border-collision normal form, a model of an oscillator subject to dry friction, and a model of a DC/DC power converter.;32 Method-Procedure

Fully nonlocal two-projector norm-conserving pseudopotentials are shown to be compatible with a systematic approach to the optimization of convergence with the size of the plane-wave basis.;42 Results-Reference

Persistent currents in Bose condensates with a scalar order parameter are stabilized by the topology of the order parameter manifold.;1 Background
