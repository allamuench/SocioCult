We analyze the magnetic kinematic dynamo in a conducting fluid where a stationary shear flow is accompanied by relatively weak random velocity fluctuations.
The diffusionless and diffusion regimes are described.
The growth rates of the magnetic field moments are related to the statistical characteristics of the flow describing divergence of the Lagrangian trajectories.
The magnetic field correlation functions are examined, and their growth rates and scaling behavior are established.
General assertions are illustrated by the explicit solution of a model where the velocity field is short-correlated in time.
