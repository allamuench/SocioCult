The effect of surface states of silicon nanocrystals embedded in silicon dioxide on the photoluminescent properties of the nanocrystals is reported.
We have investigated the time-resolved and stationary photoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals in the matrix of silicon dioxide in the visible and infrared spectral ranges at 77 and 300 K.
The structures containing silicon nanocrystals were prepared by the high-temperature annealing of multilayer SiOx/SiO2 films.
The understanding of the experimental results on photoluminescence is underlain by a model of autolocalized states arising on surface Si-Si dimers.
The emission of autocatalized excitons is found for the first time, and the energy level of the autolocalized states is determined.
The effect of these states on the mechanism of the excitation and the photoluminescence properties of nanocrystals is discussed for a wide range of their dimensions.
It is reliably shown that the cause of the known blue boundary of photoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals in the silicon dioxide matrix is the capture of free excitons on autolocalized surface states.
