The equation of state is investigated for a thin superconducting film in a longitudinal magnetic film and with strong spin-orbit interaction at the critical point.
As a first step, the state with the maximal value of the magnetic field for a given value of spin-orbit interaction at T = 0 is chosen.
This state is investigagted in the low-temperature region.
The temperature contribution to the equation of state is weakly singular.
