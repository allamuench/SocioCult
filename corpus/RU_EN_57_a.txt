The time dependence of correlations between the photons emitted from a microcavity with an embedded quantum dot under incoherent pumping is studied theoretically.
Analytic expressions for the second-order correlation function g(2)(t) are presented in strong and weak coupling regimes.
The qualitative difference between the incoherent and coherent pumping schemes in the strong coupling case is revealed: under incoherent pumping, the correlation function demonstrates pronounced Rabi oscillations, but in the resonant pumping case, these oscillations are suppressed.
At high incoherent pumping, the correlations decay monoexponentially.
The decay time nonmonotonically depends on the pumping value and has a maximum corresponding to the self-quenching transition.
