Friction of elastic bodies is connected with the passing through the metastable states that arise at the contact of surfaces rubbing against each other.
Three models are considered that give rise to the metastable states.
Friction forces and their dependence on the pressure are calculated.
In Appendix A, the contact problem of elasticity theory is solved with adhesion taken into account.
