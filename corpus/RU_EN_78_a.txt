Basic equations of diffusional kinetics in alloys are statistically derived using the master equation approach.
To describe diffusional transformations in substitution alloys, we derive the ``quasi-equilibrium'' kinetic equation that generalizes its earlier versions by taking possible ``interaction renormalization'' effects into account.
For the interstitial alloys Me-X, we derive an explicit expression for the diffusivity D of an interstitial atom X.
This expression notably differs from those used in previous phenomenological treatments.
This microscopic expression for D is applied to describe the diffusion of carbon in austenite based on some simple models of carbon-carbon interaction.
The results obtained enable us to make certain conclusions about the real form of these interactions and about the scale of the ``transition state entropy'' for diffusion of carbon in austenite.
