We describe a simple method of incorporating the finite mass of the nucleus directly into atomic variational Monte Carlo calculations.
To test this algorithm we computed the energy and 20 other properties of 4He.
We then compared these values with those obtained from our earlier infinite nuclear mass algorithm.
All of our expectation values are in excellent agreement with previous results on this system.
