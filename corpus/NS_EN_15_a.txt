We discuss electron scattering in a one-dimensional delta barrier potential with either time-dependent coupling constant (classical model) or a coupling constant that is linear in a boson coordinate (quantum model).
We find an exact continued fraction solution and Fano like resonances in the transmission coefficient.
In the quantum model, energies for perfect transmission exist below the first sideband threshold.
