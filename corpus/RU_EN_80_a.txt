We suggest a qualitative explanation of oscillations in electron capture decays of hydrogen-like 140 Pr and 142 Pm ions observed recently in an ion experimental storage ring (ESR) of Gesellschaft f√ºr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) mbH, Darmstadt, Germany.
This explanation is based on the electron multiphoton Rabi oscillations between two Zeeman states of the hyperfine ground level with the total angular momentum F=1/2.
The Zeeman splitting is produced by a constant magnetic field in the ESR.
Transitions between these states are produced by the second, sufficiently strong alternating magnetic field that approximates realistic fields in the GSI ESR.
The Zeeman splitting amounts to only about 10-5 eV.
This allows explaining the observed quantum beats with the period 7 s.
