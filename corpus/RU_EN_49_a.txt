The angular dependence of Raman scattering selection rules for optical phonons in short-period (001) GaAs/AlAs superlattices is calculated and studied experimentally.
Experiments are performed using a micro-Raman setup, in the scattering geometry with the wave vectors of the incident and scattered light lying in the plane of superlattices (so-called in-plane geometry).
Phonon frequencies are calculated using the Born model taking the Coulomb interaction into account in the rigid-ion approximation.
Raman scattering spectra are calculated in the framework of the deformation potential and electro-optical mechanisms.
Calculations show an angular dependence of the selection rules for optical phonons with different directions of the wave vectors.
Drastic differences in the selection rules are found for experimental and calculated spectra.
Presumably, these differences are due to the Fr√∂hlich mechanism in Raman scattering for short-period superlattices.
