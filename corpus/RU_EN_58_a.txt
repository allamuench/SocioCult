We study experimentally and theoretically the effect of Eu doping and partial oxygen isotope substitution on the transport and magnetic characteristics and spin-state transitions in Pr1-y Euy)0.7 Ca0.3 CoO3 cobaltites.
The Eu doping level y is chosen in the range of the phase diagram near the crossover between the ferromagnetic and spin-state transitions (0.10 < y < 0.20).
We prepared a series of samples with different degrees of enrichment by the heavy oxygen isotope 18 O, namely, with 90 %, 67 %, 43 %, 17 %, and 0 % of 18O.
Based on the measurements of the ac magnetic susceptibility χ(T) and electrical resistivity ρ(T), we analyze the evolution of the sample properties with the change of the Eu and 18 O content.
It is demonstrated that the effect of increasing the 18 O content on the system is similar to that of increasing the Eu content.
The band structure calculations of the energy gap between t2g and eg bands including the renormalization of this gap due to the electron-phonon interaction reveals the physical mechanisms underlying this similarity.
