The \cN=1 SQCD with SU(Nc) colors and NF flavors of light quarks is considered within the dynamical scenario that assumes that quarks can be in the two different phases only: the heavy-quark phase, where they are confined, and the phase of higgsed quarks, at the appropriate values of the Lagrangian parameters.
The mass spectra of this (direct) theory and its Seiberg dual are obtained and compared for quarks of small equal or unequal masses.
It is shown that in those regions of the parameter space where an additional small parameter exists (it is 0<b_0/N_F=(3N_c-N_F)/N_F\ll 1 at the right end of the conformal window, where the direct theory is weakly coupled in the vicinity of its IR fixed point, or its analog 0<\overline{b}_0/N_F=(2N_F-3N_c)/N_F\ll 1 for the dual theory at the left end of the conformal window), the mass spectra of the direct and dual theories are parametrically different.
A number of other regimes are also considered.
