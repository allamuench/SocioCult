We study an excitation of surface plasmons (SPs) due to the scattering of light by a dipole nanoparticle located near a flat air-metal interface.
It is well known that such a scattering can reveal asymmetric behavior of excited SPs with respect to the plane of incidence of light.
This asymmetric SP excitation, which takes place at the incidence of elliptically polarized light, is often associated with the so-called photonic spin Hall effect caused by the interplay between rotating polarization of a nanoparticle and the intrinsic field angular momentum of the SP.
We show that this photonic spin Hall effect can be applied for the SP excitation control, which allows managing the SP directivity pattern and amplitude.
The possibilities of SP control can also be extended using nanoparticles with anisotropic polarizability.
We believe that manipulations with SPs at a nanometer scale may find some applications in modern nanoplasmonics.
