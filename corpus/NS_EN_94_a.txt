We prove results that enable the efficient and natural realization of a large class of robust heteroclinic networks in coupled identical cell systems.
We also propose some general conjectures that relate a natural and large class of robust heteroclinic networks that occur in networks modelled by equations of Lotkaâ€“Volterra type, and certain networks of symmetric systems, to robust heteroclinic networks in coupled cell networks.
