The (p, α) reaction was studied on a208Pb target at 16.475 MeV.
Nineteen states were observed in205Tl, up to 3.6 MeV in excitation.
Angular distributions were obtained for five strong proton-hole transitions, and DWBA fits made to determinelj values.
Results are compared with previous206Pb(t, α)205Tl,206Pb(d,3He)205Tl,205Tl(p, p′), and205Tl(n, n′) work.
