Many interesting nonlinear effects are based on the strong interaction of motional degrees of freedom of atoms with an optical cavity field.
Among them is the spatial self-organization of atoms in a pattern where the atoms group in either odd or even sites of the cavity-induced optical potential.
An experimental observation of this effect can be simplified by using, along with the original cavity-induced feedback, an additional electronic feedback based on the detection of light leaking the cavity and the control of the optical potential for the atoms.
Following our previous study, we show that this approach is more efficient from the laser power perspective than the original scheme without the electronic feedback.
