We investigate the time evolution of filling numbers of localized electrons in the system of two coupled single-level quantum dots (QDs) connected with the continuous-spectrum states in the presence of Coulomb interaction.
We considered correlation functions of all orders for electrons in the QDs by decoupling higher-order correlations between localized and band electrons in the reservoir.
We analyze different initial charge configurations and consider Coulomb correlations between localized electrons both within the dots and between the different dots.
We reveal the presence of a dynamical charge trapping effect in the first QD in the situation where both dots are occupied at the initial instant.
We also find an analytic solution for the time-dependent filling numbers of the localized electrons for a particular configuration of the dots.
