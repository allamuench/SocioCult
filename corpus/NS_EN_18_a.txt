We develop a method of modified hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks, achieving complete immunity to the frequency shifts induced by the probing fields themselves.
Using particular pulse sequences with tailored phases, frequencies, and durations, we can derive an error signal centered exactly at the unperturbed atomic resonance with a steep discriminant which is robust against variations in the probe shift.
We experimentally investigate the scheme using the magnetically-induced 1S0âˆ’3P0 transition in 88Sr, demonstrating automatic suppression of a sizeable \num{2e-13} probe Stark shift to below \num{1e-16} even with very large errors in shift compensation.
