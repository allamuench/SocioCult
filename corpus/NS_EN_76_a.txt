Radiative charge exchange collisions between a carbon atom ${\rm{C}}({}^{3}P)$ and a helium ion ${\mathrm{He}}^{+}({}^{2}S)$, both in their ground state, are investigated theoretically.
Detailed quantum chemistry calculations are carried out to obtain potential energy curves and transition dipole matrix elements for doublet and quartet molecular states of the HeC+ cation.
Radiative charge transfer cross sections and rate coefficients are calculated and are found at thermal and lower energies to be large compared to those for direct charge transfer.
The present results might be applicable to modelling the complex interplay of $[{\rm{C}}\,{\rm{II}}$ (or ${{\rm{C}}}^{+}$), ${\rm{C}}$, and $\mathrm{CO}$ at the boundaries of interstellar photon dominated regions and in x-ray dominated regions, where the abundance of ${\mathrm{He}}^{+}$ affects the abundance of $\mathrm{CO}$.
