The theory of Raman scattering in half-metals by optical phonons interacting with conduction electrons is developed.
We evaluate the effect of electron-phonon interactions at ferromagnetic ordering in terms of the Boltzmann equation for carriers.
The chemical potential is found to decrease as the temperature decreases.
Both the linewidth and frequency shift exhibit a dependence on temperature.
