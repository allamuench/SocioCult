I discuss how parameters describing inflation in the very early universe may be related to primordial perturbation spectra.
Precision observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) such as those provided by the WMAP satellite offer an unprecedented window onto the physics of the very early universe.
To theorists exploring speculative models of physics at high energies, the CMB offers us the chance to put our ideas to the test.
