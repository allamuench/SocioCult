The mechanisms and structural elements of instability whose evolution results in the occurrence of the collapse are studied in the scope of the rotating shallow water model with a horizontally nonuniform density.
The diagram stability based on the integral collapse criterion is suggested to explain system behavior in the space of constants of motion.
Analysis of the instability shows that two collapse scenarios are possible.
One scenario implies anisotropic collapse during which the contact area of a collapsing drop-like fragment with the bottom contracts into a rotating segment.
The other implies isotropic contraction of the area into a point.
