A two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in yields and spectra derived from the charge-multiplicity dependence of 200 GeV p–p collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider is extended to describe p–p spectrum data from the large hadron collider (LHC) up to 13 TeV.
The LHC data include spectrum ratios that provide only partial information on the TCM.
The LHC ratio method is applied to well-understood 200 GeV spectrum data to derive an algebraic link between spectrum ratios and the full TCM.
Some aspects of the form of the hard component on transverse momentum are found to be n ch dependent.
LHC spectrum ratios are then analyzed to obtain n ch and collision-energy (over three orders of magnitude) dependence of isolated soft and hard TCM spectrum components.
The energy dependence of the spectrum soft component is a new result suggesting a relation to Gribov diffusion.
The spectrum hard component varies simply and smoothly with n ch suggesting bias of the underlying jet spectrum and linearly with QCD parameter $\mathrm{log}(s/{s}_{0})$, its properties consistent with minimum-bias reconstructed-jet spectrum measurements.
