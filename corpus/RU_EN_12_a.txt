A new approach to the diffusion-limited reaction kinetics for particles migrating by random walks on discrete lattice sites and reacting when two particles occupy the same site is extended to a more general case of a large reaction radius and applied to the problem of the recombination rate of point defects in cubic lattices.
Numerical calculations correctly reproduce the analytic expressions in the limit cases considered in previous work and in the general case represent a step-wise dependence of the reaction rate on the recombination radius.
