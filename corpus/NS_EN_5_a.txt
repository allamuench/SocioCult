We present the final catalogue of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ), based on Anglo-Australian Telescope 2dF spectroscopic observations of 44576 colour-selected (u b_J r) objects with 18.25<b_J<20.85 selected from APM scans of UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) photographic plates.
The 2QZ comprises 23338 QSOs, 12292 galactic stars (including 2071 white dwarfs) and 4558 compact narrow-emission-line galaxies.
We obtained a reliable spectroscopic identification for 86 per cent of objects observed with 2dF.
We also report on the 6dF QSO Redshift Survey (6QZ), based on UKST 6dF observations of 1564 brighter 16<b_J<18.25 sources selected from the same photographic input catalogue.
In total, we identified 322 QSOs spectroscopically in the 6QZ.
The completed 2QZ is, by more than a factor 50, the largest homogeneous QSO catalogue ever constructed at these faint limits (b_J<20.85) and high QSO surface densities (5 QSOs deg^-2).
As such it represents an important resource in the study of the Universe at moderate-to-high redshifts.
As an example of the results possible with the 2QZ, we also present our most recent analysis of the optical QSO luminosity function and its cosmological evolution with redshift.
For a flat, Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lam=0.7, Universe, we find that a double power law with luminosity evolution that is exponential in look-back time, t, of the form L*(z) exp(6.15t), equivalent to an e-folding time of 2Gyr, provides an acceptable fit to the redshift dependence of the QSO luminosity function over the range [0.4 < z < 2.1 and M_bJ<-22.5.
Evolution described by a quadratic in redshift is also an acceptable fit, with L*(z)~10^(1.39z-0.29z^2).
