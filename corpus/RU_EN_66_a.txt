We theoretically study the vortex matter structure in low-dimensional systems with superconducting order induced by proximity to a bulk superconductor.
We analyze the effects of microscopic coupling mechanisms between the two systems and the effects of possible mismatch in the band structures of these materials on the energy spectrum of vortex-core electrons.
The unusual structure of vortex cores is discussed in the context of recent tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy experiments.
