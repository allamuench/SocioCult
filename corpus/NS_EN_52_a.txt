An ensemble of pure numbers of the order of 10122 is produced naturally from the fundamental parameters of modern cosmology.
This new large-number coincidence problem is resolved by demonstrating implicit physical connections that follow from the standard cosmological model.
However, the occurrence of the new large-number coincidence combined with the known coincidence among pure numbers of the order of 1040 poses a distinct problem that is resolved with a scaling law for the cosmological constant that was originally proposed by Zel'dovich.
