Elementary processes capable of producing neutrons in a thunderstorm atmosphere are analyzed.
The efficiency of nuclear fusion 2 H(2 H,n)3 He, photonuclear reactions (γ,Xn), electrodisintegration reactions nm A(e-,n)n-1m A, and reactions e-(p+,n) ue opposite to the β-decay is evaluated.
It is shown that an unrealistically strong electric field is required for the nuclear fusion to be responsible for the neutron production in the lightning channel.
The generation of neutrons in a thunderstorm atmosphere is connected with photonuclear (γ,Xn) and, at a much lower degree, electrodisintegration reactions, the relativistic runaway electron avalanches being primary parent processes.
