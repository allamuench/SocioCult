We consider formulations of the functional renormalization-group (fRG) flow for correlated electronic systems with the dynamical mean-field theory as a starting point.
We classify the corresponding renormalization-group schemes into those neglecting one-particle irreducible six-point vertices with respect to the local Green's functions) and neglecting one-particle reducible six-point vertices.
The former class is represented by the recently introduced DMF2RG approach 31, but also by the scale-dependent generalization of the one-particle irreducible representation (with respect to local Green's functions, 1PI-LGF) of the generating functional 20.
The second class is represented by the fRG flow within the dual fermion approach 16,32.
We compare formulations of the fRG approach in each of these cases and suggest their further application to study 2D systems within the Hubbard model.
