Phase behavior of DODAB aqueous solution, prepared without sonication, was studied by adiabatic scanning calorimetry.
Measurements revealed four phase transitions with the temperatures 35.2, 39.6, 44.6, and 52.4 at heating and one transition at the temperature 40.4 at cooling.
The first three transitions at heating occur in unilamellar vesicles.
The first and third transitions correspond to the subgel-gel and gel-liquid phase transitions, corresponding enthalpy jumps are equal to 33 and 49 kJ/mol.
The second transition appears after some aging and is similar to gel-ripple phase transition in a DPPC solution, with the enthalpy jump under the transition exceeding 7.4 kJ/mol.
The transition occurs in unilamellar vesicles.
The transition at the temperature 52.4 occurs in another subsystem of the solution, which we believe to be multilamellar vesicles.
The enthalpy jump at this transition is equal to 97 kJ/mol, and data analysis suggests that this is a subgel-liquid transition.
The phase transition at cooling is the liquid-gel transition in unilamellar vesicles.
During the measurements, a slow evolution of the solution occurs, consisting in a change of concentrations of unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles.
This transformation mainly occurs at low temperatures.
