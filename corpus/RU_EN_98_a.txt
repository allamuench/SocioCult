We investigate the photon emission from the electrosphere of a quark star.
We show that at temperatures T\approx 0.1-1 MeV, the dominating mechanism is the bremsstrahlung due to bending of electron trajectories in the mean Coulomb field of the electrosphere.
The radiated energy for this mechanism is much larger than that for the Bethe-Heitler bremsstrahlung.
The energy flux from the mean field bremsstrahlung also exceeds the one from the tunnel e+e- pair creation.
We demonstrate that the LPM suppression of the photon emission is negligible.
