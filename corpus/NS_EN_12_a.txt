We revisit the classical stability versus accuracy dilemma for the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM).
Our goal is a stable method of second-order accuracy for fluid dynamics based on the lattice Bhatnager-Gross-Krook method (LBGK).
The LBGK scheme can be recognised as a discrete dynamical system generated by free-flight and entropic involution.
In this framework the stability and accuracy analysis are more natural.
We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for second-order accurate fluid dynamics modelling.
In particular, it is proven that in order to guarantee second-order accuracy the distribution should belong to a distinguished surface - the invariant film (up to second-order in the time step).
This surface is the trajectory of the (quasi)equilibrium distribution surface under free-flight.
The main instability mechanisms are identified.
The simplest recipes for stabilisation add no artificial dissipation (up to second-order) and provide second-order accuracy of the method.
Two other prescriptions add some artificial dissipation locally and prevent the system from loss of positivity and local blow-up.
Demonstration of the proposed stable LBGK schemes are provided by the numerical simulation of a 1D shock tube and the unsteady 2D-flow around a square-cylinder (up to Reynolds number 10000).
