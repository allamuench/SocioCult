We report the results of theoretical investigations of the tunneling current noise spectra through a single-level impurity both in the presence and in the absence of electron-phonon interaction based on the nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism.
We show that due to the quantum nature of tunneling, the Fano factor is dramatically different from the Poisson limit both in the presence and in the absence of inelastic processes.
The results are demonstrated to be sensitive to the tunneling contact parameters.
