Building on the first part of this paper, we develop the theory of functional asynchronous networks.
We show that a large class of functional asynchronous networks can be (uniquely) represented as feedforward networks connecting events or dynamical modules.
For these networks we can give a complete description of the network function in terms of the function of the events comprising the network: the modularization of dynamics theorem.
We give examples to illustrate the main results.
