We describe the interaction of a Rayleigh surface acoustic wave (SAW) traveling on the semiconductor substrate with the excitonic gas in a double quantum well located on the substrate surface.
We study the SAW attenuation and its velocity renormalization due to the coupling to excitons.
Both the deformation potential and piezoelectric mechanisms of the SAW-exciton interaction are considered.
We focus on the frequency and excitonic density dependences of the SAW absorption coefficient and velocity renormalization at temperatures both above and well below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of the excitonic gas.
We demonstrate that the SAW attenuation and velocity renormalization are strongly different below and above the critical temperature.
