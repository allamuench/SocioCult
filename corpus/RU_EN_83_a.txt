An expansion of the nearly free-electron model constructed by Frantzeskakis, Pons, and Grioni [1] describing quantum states at the Bi/Si(111) interface with the giant spin-orbit coupling is developed and applied for the band structure and spin polarization calculation, as well as for the linear response analysis of the charge current and induced spin caused by a dc field and by electromagnetic radiation.
It is found that the large spin-orbit coupling in this system may allow resolving the spin-dependent properties even at room temperature and at a realistic collision rate.
The geometry of the atomic lattice combined with spin-orbit coupling leads to an anisotropic response for both the current and spin components related to the orientation of the external field.
The in-plane dc electric field produces only the in-plane components of spin in the sample, while both the in-plane and out-of-plane spin components can be excited by normally propagating electromagnetic wave with different polarizations.
