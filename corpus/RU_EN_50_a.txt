In a system of N interacting single-level quantum dots (QDs) we study relaxation dynamics and current-voltage characteristics determined by symmetry properties of the QD arrangement.
Different numbers of dots, initial charge configurations, and various coupling regimes to reservoirs are considered.
We reveal that effective charge trapping occurs for particular regimes of coupling to the reservoir when more than two dots form a ring structure with the CN spatial symmetry.
We reveal that the effective charge trapping caused by the CN spatial symmetry of N coupled QDs depends on the number of dots and the way of coupling to the reservoirs.
We demonstrate that the charge trapping effect is directly connected with the formation of dark states, which are not coupled to reservoirs due to the system spatial symmetry CN.
We also reveal the symmetry blockade of the tunneling current caused by the presence of dark states.
