We have surveyed four globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf galaxy for RR Lyrae stars, using archival HST observations.
We identify 197 new RR Lyrae stars in these four clusters.
Despite the short observational baseline, we derive periods, light-curves, and photometric parameters for each.
The Fornax clusters have exceptionally large RR Lyrae specific frequencies compared with the Galactic globular clusters.
Furthermore, the Fornax cluster RR Lyrae stars are unusual in that their characteristics are intermediate between the two Galactic Oosterhoff groups.
In this respect the Fornax clusters are similar to the field populations in several dwarf galaxies.
We revise previous measurements of the HB morphology in each cluster.
The Fornax clusters closely resemble the ''young'' Galactic halo population defined by Zinn.
The existence of the second parameter effect among the Fornax clusters is also confirmed.
Finally, we determine foreground reddening and distance estimates for each cluster.
We find a mean distance modulus to Fornax of (m-M)_0 = 20.66 +/- 0.03 (random) +/- 0.15 (systematic).
Our measurements are consistent with a line of sight depth of 8-10 kpc for this galaxy, matching its projected dimensions, and incompatible with tidal model explanations for the observed high velocity dispersions in many dSph galaxies.
Dark matter dominance is suggested.
